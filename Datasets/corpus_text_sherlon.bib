Abstract = {{Learning from text data often involves a loop of tasks that iterate
   between foraging for information and synthesizing it in incremental
   hypotheses. Past research has shown the advantages of using spatial
   workspaces as a means for synthesizing information through externalizing
   hypotheses and creating spatial schemas. However, spatializing the
   entirety of datasets becomes prohibitive as the number of documents
   available to the analysts grows, particularly when only a small subset
   are relevant to the tasks at hand. To address this issue, we applied the
   multi-model semantic interaction (MSI) technique, which leverages user
   interactions to aid in the display layout (as was seen in previous
   semantic interaction work), forage for new, relevant documents as
   implied by the interactions, and place them in context of the user's
   existing spatial layout. Thus, this approach cleanly embeds visual
   analytics of big text collections directly into the human sensemaking
   process.}},

Title = {{A Visual Analytics Approach for Interactive Document Clustering}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is a necessary step in various analytical and
   automated activities. When guided by the user, algorithms are tailored
   to imprint a perspective on the clustering process that reflects the
   user's understanding of the dataset. More than just allow for customized
   adjustment of the clusters, a visual analytics approach will provide
   tools for the user to draw new insights on the collection. While
   contributing his or her perspective, the user will also acquire a deeper
   understanding of the data set. To that effect, we propose a novel visual
   analytics system for interactive document clustering. We built our
   system on top of clustering algorithms that can adapt to user's
   feedback. In the proposed system, initial clustering is created based on
   the user-defined number of clusters and the selected clustering
   algorithm. A set of coordinated visualizations allow the examination of
   the dataset and the results of the clustering. The visualization
   provides the user with the highlights of individual documents and
   understanding of the evolution of documents over the time period to
   which they relate. The users then interact with the process by means of
   changing key-terms that drive the process according to their knowledge
   of the documents domain. In key-term-based interaction, the user assigns
   a set of key-terms to each target cluster to guide the clustering
   algorithm. We have improved that process with a novel algorithm for
   choosing proper seeds for the clustering. Results demonstrate that not
   only the system has improved considerably its precision, but also its
   effectiveness in the document-based decision making. A set of
   quantitative experiments and a user study have been conducted to show
   the advantages of the approach for document analytics based on
   clustering. We performed and reported on the use of the framework in a
   real decision-making scenario that relates users discussion by email to
   decision making in improving patient care. Results show that the
   framework is useful even for more complex data sets such as email
   conversations.}},

Abstract = {{UPDATED-December 29, 2017. Document clustering is an efficient way to
   get insight into large text collections. Due to the personalized nature
   of document clustering, even the best fully automatic algorithms cannot
   create clusters that accurately reflect the user's perspectives. To
   incorporate the user's perspective in the clustering process and, at the
   same time, effectively visualize document collections to enhance user's
   sense-making of data, we propose a novel visual analytics system for
   interactive document clustering. We built our system on top of
   clustering algorithms that can adapt to user's feedback. First, the
   initial clustering is created based on the user-defined number of
   clusters and the selected clustering algorithm. Second, the clustering
   result is visualized to the user. A collection of coordinated
   visualization modules and document projection is designed to guide the
   user towards a better insight into the document collection and clusters.
   The user changes clusters and key-terms iteratively as a feedback to the
   clustering algorithm until the result is satisfactory. In key-term based
   interaction, the user assigns a set of key-terms to each target cluster
   to guide the clustering algorithm. A set of quantitative experiments, a
   use case, and a user study have been conducted to show the advantages of
   the approach for document analytics based on clustering.}},

Abstract = {{We present an online visual analytics approach to helping users explore
   and understand hierarchical topic evolution in high-volume text streams.
   The key idea behind this approach is to identify representative topics
   in incoming documents and align them with the existing representative
   topics that they immediately follow (in time). To this end, we learn a
   set of streaming tree cuts from topic trees based on user-selected focus
   nodes. A dynamic Bayesian network model has been developed to derive the
   tree cuts in the incoming topic trees to balance the fitness of each
   tree cut and the smoothness between adjacent tree cuts. By connecting
   the corresponding topics at different times, we are able to provide an
   overview of the evolving hierarchical topics. A sedimentation-based
   visualization has been designed to enable the interactive analysis of
   streaming text data from global patterns to local details. We evaluated
   our method on real-world datasets and the results are generally
   favorable.}},

Abstract = {{Central to many text analysis methods is the notion of a concept: a set

   such techniques may result in false positive errors because of the
   polysemy of natural language. To mitigate this problem, we present a
   visual analytics system called ConceptVector that guides a user in
   building such concepts and then using them to analyze documents.
   Document-analysis case studies with real-world datasets demonstrate the
   fine-grained analysis provided by ConceptVector. To support the
   elaborate modeling of concepts, we introduce a bipolar concept model and
   support for specifying irrelevant words. We validate the interactive
   lexicon building interface by a user study and expert reviews.
   Quantitative evaluation shows that the bipolar lexicon generated with
   our methods is comparable to human-generated ones.}},

Abstract = {{The GB railways collect about 150,000 text-based records each year on
   potentially dangerous events and the numbers are on the increase in the
   Close Call System. The huge volume of text requires considerable human
   effort to its interpretation. This work focuses on visual text analysis
   techniques of Close Call records to extract safety lessons more quickly
   and efficiently. This paper treats basic steps for visual text analysis
   based on an evaluation test using a pre-constructed test set of 150
   Close Call records for ``Trespass{''}, ``Slip/Trip hazards on site{''}
   and ``Level crossing{''}. The results demonstrate that visual text
   analysis can be used to identify the risks in a small-scale test set but
   differences in language use by different cohorts of people interferes
   with straightforward risk identification in larger sets. This work paves
   the way to machine-assisted interpretation of text-based safety records
   which can speed up risk identification in a large corpus of text. It
   also demonstrates how new possibilities open up to develop interactive
   visualisations tools that allow data analysts to use text analysis
   techniques for risk analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{BIG DATA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{49-58}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Analysts face many steep challenges when performing sensemaking tasks on
   collections of textual information larger than can be reasonably
   analyzed without computational assistance. To scale up such sensemaking
   tasks, new methods are needed to interactively integrate human cognitive
   sensemaking activity with machine learning. Towards that goal, we offer
   a human-in-the-loop computational model that mirrors the human
   sensemaking process, and consists of foraging and synthesis
   sub-processes. We model the synthesis loop as an interactive spatial
   projection and the foraging loop as an interactive relevance ranking
   combined with topic modeling. We combine these two components of the
   sensemaking process using semantic interaction such that the human's
   spatial synthesis actions are transformed into automated foraging and
   synthesis of new relevant information. Ultimately, the model's ability
   to forage as a result of the analyst's synthesis activities makes
   interacting with big text data easier and more efficient, thereby
   facilitating analysts' sensemaking ability. We discuss the interaction
   design and theory behind our interactive sensemaking model. The model is
   embodied in a novel visual analytics prototype called Cosmos in which
   analysts synthesize structure within the larger corpus by directly
   interacting with a reduced-dimensionality space to express relationships
   on a subset of data. We then demonstrate how Cosmos supports sensemaking
   tasks with a realistic scenario that investigates the affect of natural
   disasters in Adelaide, Australia in September 2016 using a database of
   over 30,000 news articles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The awareness of emerging technologies is essential for strategic
   decision making in enterprises. Emerging and decreasing technological
   trends could lead to strengthening the competitiveness and market
   positioning. The exploration, detection and identification of such
   trends can be essentially supported through information visualization,
   trend mining and in particular through the combination of those.
   Commonly, trends appear first in science and scientific documents.
   However, those documents do not provide sufficient information for
   analyzing and identifying emerging trends. It is necessary to enrich
   data, extract information from the integrated data, measure the gradient
   of trends over time and provide effective interactive visualizations. We
   introduce in this paper an approach for integrating, enriching, mining,
   analyzing, identifying and visualizing emerging trends from scientific
   documents. Our approach enhances the state of the art in visual trend
   analytics by investigating the entire analysis process and providing an
   approach for enabling human to explore undetected potentially emerging
   trends.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel interactive visualization technique that
   helps in gathering insights from large volumes of text generated through
   dyadic communications. The emphasis is specifically on showing content
   evolution and modification with passage of time. The challenge lies in
   presenting not only the content as a stand-alone but also understand how
   the present is related to the past. For example analyzing large volumes
   of emails can show how communication among a set of people have
   progressed or evolved over time, may be along with the roles of the
   communicators. It can also show how the content has changed or evolved.
   In order to depict the changes, the email repositories are first
   clustered using a novel algorithm. The clusters are further time-stamped
   and correlated. User-insights are provided through visualization of
   these clusters. Results of implementation over two different datasets
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of analyzing word frequencies in multiple
   text sources with the aim to give an overview of word-based similarities
   in several texts as a starting point for further analysis. To reach this
   goal, we designed a visual analytics approach composed of typical stages
   and processes, combining algorithmic analysis, visualization techniques,
   the human users with their perceptual abilities, as well as interaction
   methods for both the data analysis and the visualization component. By
   our algorithmic analysis, we first generate a multivariate dataset where
   words build the cases and the individual text sources the attributes.
   Real-valued relevances express the significances of each word in each of
   the text sources. From the visualization perspective, we describe how
   this multivariate dataset can be visualized to generate, confirm,
   rebuild, refine, or reject hypotheses with the goal to derive meaning,
   knowledge, and insights from several text sources. We discuss benefits
   and drawbacks of the visualization approaches when analyzing word
   relevances in multiple texts.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting similarity between texts is a frequently encountered text
   mining task. Because the measurement of similarity is typically composed
   of a number of metrics, and some measures are sensitive to subjective
   interpretation, a generic detector obtained using machine learning often
   has difficulties balancing the roles of different metrics according to
   the semantic context exhibited in a specific collection of texts. In
   order to facilitate human interaction in a visual analytics process for
   text similarity detection, we first map the problem of pairwise sequence
   comparison to that of image processing, allowing patterns of similarity
   to be visualized as a 2D pixelmap. We then devise a visual interface to
   enable users to construct and experiment with different detectors using
   primitive metrics, in a way similar to constructing an image processing
   pipeline. We deployed this new approach for the identification of
   commonplaces in 18th-century literary and print culture. Domain experts
   were then able to make use of the prototype system to derive new
   scholarly discoveries and generate new hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{With increasingly high volumes of conversations across social media, the
   rapid detection of emotions is of significant strategic value to
   industry practitioners. Summarizing large volumes of text with
   computational linguistics and visual analytics allows for several new
   possibilities from general trend detection to specific applications in
   marketing practice, such as monitoring product launches, campaigns and
   public relations milestones. After collecting 1.6 million user-tagged
   feelings from 12 million online posts that mention emotions, we utilized
   machine learning techniques towards building an automatic `feelings
   meter'; a tool for both researchers and practitioners to automatically
   detect emotional dimensions from text. Following several iterations, the
   test version has now taken shape as emotionVis, a dashboard prototype
   for inferring emotions from text while presenting the results for visual

Abstract = {{The analysis of research paper collections is an interesting topic that
   can give insights on whether a research area is stalled in the same
   problems, or there is a great amount of novelty every year. Previous
   research has addressed similar tasks by the analysis of keywords or
   reference lists, with different degrees of human intervention. In this
   paper, we demonstrate how, with the use of Normalized Relative
   Compression, together with a set of automated data-processing tasks, we
   can successfully visually compare research articles and document
   collections. We also achieve very similar results with Normalized
   Conditional Compression that can be applied with a regular compressor.
   With our approach, we can group papers of different disciplines, analyze
   how a conference evolves throughout the different editions, or how the
   profile of a researcher changes through the time. We provide a set of
   tests that validate our technique, and show that it behaves better for
   these tasks than other techniques previously proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Bibliographic data such as collections of scientific articles and
   citation networks have been studied extensively in information
   visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been
   built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they
   require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights
   gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual
   analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a
   carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may
   use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature
   database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly
   retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original
   bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that
   enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as
   to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept
   includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and
   meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and
   following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by
   word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user
   interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process. we
   derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a
   formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A
   questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that
   SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.}},

Title = {{Discovering temporal changes in hierarchical transportation data: Visual

Abstract = {{Analyzing important changes to massive transportation datasets like
   national bottleneck statistics, passenger data for domestic flights,
   airline maintenance budgets, or even publication data from the
   Transportation Research Record can be extremely complex. These types of
   datasets are often grouped by attributes in a tree structure hierarchy.
   The parent child relationships of these hierarchical datasets allow for
   unique analytical opportunities, including the ability to track changes
   in the dataset at different levels of granularity, over time or between
   versions. For example, analysts can use hierarchies to uncover changes
   in the patterns of passengers flying in the United States over the last
   ten years, breaking down the data by states, cities, airports, and
   number of passengers. Exploring changes in travel patterns over time can
   help carriers make better decisions regarding their operations and
   long-range planning.
   This paper describes TreeVersity2, a web-based data comparison tool that
   provides users with information visualization techniques to find what
   has changed in a dataset over time. TreeVersity2 enables users to
   explore data that can be inherently hierarchical or not (by categorizing
   them by their attributes). An interactive textual reporting tool
   complements the visual exploration when the amount of data is very
   large. The results of two case studies conducted with transportation
   domain experts along with the results of an exit questionnaire are also
   described. TreeVersity2 preloaded with several demo datasets can be
   found at (http://treeversity.cattlab.umd.edu) along with several example
   videos. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Medieval literary traditions provide a particularly challenging test
   case for textual alignment and the visualization of variance. Whereas
   the editors of medieval traditions working with the printed page
   struggle to illustrate the complex phenomena of textual instability,
   research in screen-based visualization has made significant progress,
   allowing for complex textual situations to be captured at the micro-and
   the macro-level. This article uses visualization and a computational
   approach to identifying variance to allow the analysis of different
   medieval poetic works using the transcriptions of how they are found in
   particular manuscripts. It introduces the notion of a meso-level
   visualization, a visual representation of aligned text providing for
   comparative reading on the screen, all the while assembling
   non-contradictory, intuitive solutions for the visual exploration of
   multi-scalar variance. Building upon the literary notion of mouvance, it
   delves into medieval French literature and, in particular, different
   visualizations of three versions of the Chanson de Roland (the Oxford,
   the Chateauroux, and the Venice 4 manuscripts). The article presents
   experimental prototypes for such meso-level visualization and explores
   how they can advance our understanding of formulaically rich medieval
   poetry.}},

Abstract = {{The study of novels and the analysis of their plot, characters and other
   information entities are complex and time-consuming tasks in literary
   science. The digitization of literature and the proliferation of
   electronic books provide new opportunities to support these tasks with
   visual abstractions. Methods from the field of computational linguistics
   can be used to automatically extract entities and their relations from
   digitized novels. However, these methods have known limitations,
   especially when applied to narrative text that does often not follow a
   common schema but can have various forms. Visualizations can address the
   limitations by providing visual clues to show the uncertainty of the
   extracted information, so that literary scholars get a better idea of
   the accuracy of the methods. In addition, interaction can be used to let
   users control and adapt the extraction and visualization methods
   according to their needs. This paper presents ViTA, a web-based approach
   that combines automatic analysis methods with effective visualization
   techniques. Different views on the extracted entities are provided and
   relations between them across the plot are indicated. Two usage
   scenarios show successful applications of the approach and demonstrate
   its benefits and limitations. Furthermore, the paper discusses how
   uncertainty might be represented in the different views and how users
   can be enabled to adapt the automatic methods.}},

Abstract = {{Text annotation data in terms of a series of tagged text segments can
   pose scalability challenges within the dimensions of quantity (long
   texts bearing many annotations), configuration (overlapping annotations
   or annotations with multiple tags), or source (annotations by multiple
   annotators). Accordingly, exploration tasks such as navigating within a
   long annotated text, recognizing patterns in the annotation data or
   assessing differences between annotators can be demanding. Our approach
   of an annotation browser deals with all of these data and task
   challenges simultaneously by providing a continuous range of views on
   large amounts of complex annotation data from multiple sources. We
   achieve this by using a combined geometric/semantic zooming mechanism
   that operates on an abstract representation of the sequence of a text's
   tokens and the annotations thereupon, which is interlinked with a view
   on the text itself. The approach was developed in the context of a joint
   project with researchers from fields concerned with textual sources. We
   derive our approach's requirements from a series of tasks that are
   typical in natural language processing and digital humanities, show how
   it supports these tasks, and discuss it in the light of the feedback we
   got from our domain experts.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Text visualization and visual text analytics methods have been
   successfully applied for various tasks related to the analysis of
   individual text documents and large document collections such as
   summarization of main topics or identification of events in discourse.
   Visualization of sentiments and emotions detected in textual data has
   also become an important topic of interest, especially with regard to
   the data originating from social media. Despite the growing interest in
   this topic, the research problem related to detecting and visualizing
   various stances, such as rudeness or uncertainty, has not been
   adequately addressed by the existing approaches. The challenges
   associated with this problem include the development of the underlying
   computational methods and visualization of the corresponding multi-label
   stance classification results. In this paper, we describe our work on a
   visual analytics platform, called StanceVis Prime, which has been
   designed for the analysis of sentiment and stance in temporal text data
   from various social media data sources. The use case scenarios intended
   for StanceVis Prime include social media monitoring and research in
   sociolinguistics. The design was motivated by the requirements of
   collaborating domain experts in linguistics as part of a larger research
   project on stance analysis. Our approach involves consuming documents
   from several text stream sources and applying sentiment and stance
   classification, resulting in multiple data series associated with source
   texts. StanceVis Prime provides the end users with an overview of
   similarities between the data series based on dynamic time warping
   analysis, as well as detailed visualizations of data series values.
   Users can also retrieve and conduct both distant and close reading of
   the documents corresponding to the data series. We demonstrate our
   approach with case studies involving political targets of interest and
   several social media data sources and report preliminary user feedback
   received from a domain expert.}},

   play a role at uncovering behavior of people while reading natural

   reading order of natural text is only partially applicable to source
   code reading. We found patterns representing a linear order and also
   patterns that represent reading of the source code in execution order.
   Participants also focus more on those areas that are important to
   comprehend core functionality and we found that they skip unimportant

Abstract = {{We present an argument for using visual analytics to aid Grounded Theory
   methodologies in qualitative data analysis. Grounded theory methods
   involve the inductive analysis of data to generate novel insights and
   theoretical constructs. Making sense of unstructured text data is
   uniquely suited for visual analytics. Using natural language processing
   techniques such as parts-of-speech tagging, retrieving information
   content, and topic modeling, different parts of the data can be
   structured and semantically associated, and interactively explored,
   thereby providing conceptual depth to the guided discovery process. We
   review grounded theory methods and identify processes that can be
   enhanced through visual analytic techniques. Next, we develop an
   interface for qualitative text analysis, and evaluate our design with
   qualitative research practitioners who analyze texts with and without
   visual analytics support. The results of our study suggest how visual
   analytics can be incorporated into qualitative data analysis tools, and
   the analytic and interpretive benefits that can result.}},

Abstract = {{In our daily lives, images and texts are among the most commonly found
   data which we need to handle. We present iGraph, a graph-based approach
   for visual analytics of large image and text collections. Given such a
   collection, we compute the similarity between images, the distance
   between texts, and the connection between image and text to construct
   iGraph, a compound graph representation which encodes the underlying
   relationships among these images and texts. To enable effective visual
   navigation and comprehension of iGraph with tens of thousands of nodes
   and hundreds of millions of edges, we present a progressive solution
   that offers collection overview, node comparison, and visual
   recommendation. Our solution not only allows users to explore the entire
   collection with representative images and keywords, but also supports
   detailed comparison for understanding and intuitive guidance for
   navigation. For performance speedup, multiple GPUs and CPUs are utilized
   for processing and visualization in parallel. We experiment with two
   image and text collections and leverage a cluster driving a display wall
   of nearly 50 million pixels. We show the effectiveness of our approach
   by demonstrating experimental results and conducting a user study.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive text visualization can help users explore and gain insights
   into complex and often large document sets. One popular visualization
   strategy to represent such collections is to depict each document as a
   glyph in 2D space. These spaces have proven effective, especially when
   combined with interactive exploration methods. However, current
   exploratory approaches are largely limited to single areas of a 2D
   spatialization, lacking support for important comparative exploration
   and analysis tasks. In this paper, we extend a flexible focus+context
   exploration technique to tackle this challenge. In particular, based on
   practical tasks from the digital humanities, we focus on exploring and
   investigating relationships between entities in large document
   collections. Our approach uses natural language processing to extract
   characters and places, including information about their relationships.
   We then use linked views to facilitate visual analysis of extracted
   information artifacts. Based on two usage scenarios, we demonstrate
   successful applications of the approach and discuss its benefits and
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Financial performance is an indicator of the financial stability and the
   health of a firm. It is a measure of how well a firm uses its assets to
   generate revenues, a firm's credibility, and its ability to pay off
   debts. To study the theoretical development, empirical examinations, and
   growing trend of financial performance research, this study reviewed the
   financial performance literature based on 875 journal articles sourced
   from the Web of Science, ACM, and Scopus databases from 2005 to 2019. To
   carry out the review, we applied Cite Space and Ucinet software for
   visualization and social network analysis, statistical analysis,
   co-occurrence analysis, and other research methods. We obtained a
   panoramic depiction of the posts, authors, journals, and keywords, and
   also reviewed financial performance using the field of knowledge maps.
   Accordingly, this study highlighted the recent and future research
   trends, and found that corporate social responsibility, and the green
   and sustainable corporate environment are potential research areas.
   These findings, through the combination of bibliometric methods and a
   systematic review, provide a better understanding of the development of
   corporate financial performance for both researchers and practitioners.}},

   analysis of a literary text}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Visual analysis is a commonplace technique in geography pedagogy yet it
   is rarely used in the Australian literary studies context. This article
   explores the potential for visual analysis to contribute to the shared
   understanding of a work of literature in a university classroom setting.
   The use of visual analysis geography can encourage students to read
   texts closely and map them spatially using pen and paper. It proposes
   that literary studies educators may turn to innovative methods derived
   from geography to engage students with literary works. This article
   discusses a visual analysis assignment which centres on Jennifer Down's
   Melbourne-based novel Our Magic Hour (2016) for a Literary Studies
   subject at RMIT University delivered predominantly face- to-face in
   2018-2019 and then entirely online in 2020. I describe it as a ``messy
   mapping{''} assignment which encourages students to acknowledge the
   limitations and erasures of positivist maps, while trying to capture
   relationships between emotion and place. I argue that ``messy
   mapping{''} can activate the many connections and overlaps between texts
   and students' own personal worlds.}},

Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Historical maps are unique sources of retrospective geographical
   information. Recently, several map archives containing map series
   covering large spatial and temporal extents have been systematically
   scanned and made available to the public. The geographical information
   contained in such data archives makes it possible to extend geospatial
   analysis retrospectively beyond the era of digital cartography. However,
   given the large data volumes of such archives (e.g., more than 200,000
   map sheets in the United States Geological Survey topographic map
   archive) and the low graphical quality of older, manually-produced map
   sheets, the process to extract geographical information from these map
   archives needs to be automated to the highest degree possible. To
   understand the potential challenges (e.g., salient map characteristics
   and data quality variations) in automating large-scale information
   extraction tasks for map archives, it is useful to efficiently assess
   spatio-temporal coverage, approximate map content, and spatial accuracy
   of georeferenced map sheets at different map scales. Such preliminary
   analytical steps are often neglected or ignored in the map processing
   literature but represent critical phases that lay the foundation for any
   subsequent computational processes including recognition. Exemplified
   for the United States Geological Survey topographic map and the Sanborn
   fire insurance map archives, we demonstrate how such preliminary
   analyses can be systematically conducted using traditional analytical
   and cartographic techniques, as well as visual-analytical data mining
   tools originating from machine learning and data science.}},

   reply-chains, comparing different models and their agreement. To
   understand the inner-workings of the models, we visualize their decision

Abstract = {{Taxonomies are semantic resources that help to categorize and add
   meaning to data. In a hyperconnected world where information is
   generated at a rate that exceeds human capacities to process and make
   sense of it, such semantic resources can help to access relevant
   information more efficiently by extracting knowledge from large and
   unstructured data sets. Taxonomies are related to specific domains of
   knowledge in which they identify relevant topics. However, they have to
   be validated by experts to guarantee that its terms and relations are
   meaningful. In this paper, we introduce a semiautomatic taxonomy
   generation tool for supporting domain experts in building taxonomies
   that are then used to automatically create semantic visualizations of
   data. Our proposal combines automatic techniques to extract, sort and
   categorize terms, and empowers domain experts to take part at any stage
   of the process by providing a visual edition tool. We tested the tool's
   usability in two use cases from different domains and languages. Results
   show that all the functionalities are easy to use and interact with.
   Lessons learned from this experience will guide the design of a utility
   evaluation involving domain experts interested in data analysis and
   knowledge modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to make a bibliometric analysis of anticancer
   research literature based on the data from the Web of Science.
   Anticancer drug research references published from 2000 to 2014 were
   used. Citespace software was employed to generate the knowledge maps of
   country/institution, cited authors, cited journals, co-words and cited
   references related with anticancer drug research. Results of this
   analysis indicated that the USA is the most productive country and the
   Chinese Acad. Sci. is the most productive institution in this field.
   Maeda H is the most influential author, leading the highest citation
   author group. ``CANCER RES{''} is the most cited journal in which the
   most influential anticancer drug research articles were published.
   Mosmann's (1983) paper is a representative and symbolic reference with
   the highest co-citation of number of 146 (centrality 0.29). The five hot
   anticancer drug research topics were also disclosed; they are: (1)
   chemotherapy drugs, (2) drug delivery, (3) bioscreening, (4) drug
   resistance research, and (5) enzyme inhibitor studies. Research
   frontiers identified included drug delivery with nanoparticles,
   controlled release, metabolism and so on. These analyses will be
   valuable for the reader to grasp an overall picture of anticancer
   research and research trends during these years.}},

Abstract = {{Effective analysis of large text collections remains a challenging
   problem given the growing volume of available text data. Recently, text
   mining techniques have been rapidly developed for automatically
   extracting key information from massive text data. Topic modeling, as
   one of the novel techniques that extracts a thematic structure from
   documents, is widely used to generate text summarization and foster an
   overall understanding of the corpus content. Although powerful, this
   technique may not be directly applicable for general analytics scenarios
   since the topics and topic-document relationship are often presented
   probabilistically in models. Moreover, information that plays an
   important role in knowledge discovery, for example, times and authors,
   is hardly reflected in topic modeling for comprehensive analysis. In
   this paper, we address this issue by presenting a visual analytics
   system, VISTopic, to help users make sense of large document collections
   based on topic modeling. VISTopic first extracts a set of hierarchical
   topics using a novel hierarchical latent tree model (HLTM) (Liu et al.,
   2014). In specific, a topic view accounting for the model features is
   designed for overall understanding and interactive exploration of the
   topic organization. To leverage multi-perspective information for visual
   analytics, VISTopic further provides an evolution view to reveal the
   trend of topics and a document view to show details of topical
   documents. Three case studies based on the dataset of IEEE VIS
   conference demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in gaining
   insights from large document collections. (C) 2017 Zhejiang University

Abstract = {{When text visualization comes into the field of MAR (Mobile Augmented
   Reality), some problems go with it. Firstly, the natural object in the
   real scene holds abundant text information. Trying to recognize the
   natural object as a visual element rather than a marker, make text data
   intuitively understand. But MAR has been restricted by mobile computing
   speed and capability. Until now, the limitation makes text visualization
   difficult to meet the users' increasing needs in NFT (Natural Feature
   Tracking). Tools have been needed to recognize natural object to obtain
   considerable text information; even worse, being limited by a small
   screen of mobile, two-dimensional text visualization cannot intuitively
   and comprehensively present all kinds of text information, and
   interaction methods in text visualization are too insufficient to meet
   users' needs. The main technical contribution to the work is a natural
   feature recognition algorithm. The work is based on WebAR (Web-based AR)
   and an inverse BOVW (Bag of View Words) model. Transforming the feature
   points matching problem into a tree search problem. Compared with
   conventional BOVW, inverse BOVW drastically reduces the consumption of
   space and time; WA VIS shortens the time cost of others ranged from
   8.5\% to 13.7\% with accuracy in 95\%. And also, WebGL (Web Graphics
   Library) enriches interaction methods of text visualization in
   three-dimensional space with MAR. The test results verified that the
   proposed method can effectively improve the recognition speed and
   accuracy of the natural image in MAR for text visualization, enrich
   interaction in text visualization with MAR.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamically mining textual information streams to gain real-time
   situational awareness is especially challenging with social media
   systems where throughput and velocity properties push the limits of a
   static analytical approach. In this paper, we describe an interactive
   visual analytics system, called Matisse, that aids with the discovery
   and investigation of trends in streaming text. Matisse addresses the
   challenges inherent to text stream mining through the following
   technical contributions: (1) robust stream data management, (2)
   automated sentiment/emotion analytics, (3) interactive coordinated
   visualizations, and (4) a flexible drill-down interaction scheme that
   accesses multiple levels of detail. In addition to positive/negative
   sentiment prediction, Matisse provides fine-grained emotion
   classification based on Valence, Arousal, and Dominance dimensions and a
   novel machine learning process. Information from the sentiment/emotion
   analytics are fused with raw data and summary information to feed
   temporal, geospatial, term frequency, and scatterplot visualizations
   using a multi-scale, coordinated interaction model. After describing
   these techniques, we conclude with a practical case study focused on
   analyzing the Twitter sample stream during the week of the 2013 Boston
   Marathon bombings. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of
   Matisse at providing guided situational awareness of significant trends
   in social media streams by orchestrating computational power and human
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an interactive visual information retrieval
   and recommendation system, called VisIRR, for large-scale document
   discovery. VisIRR effectively combines the paradigms of (1) a passive
   pull through query processes for retrieval and (2) an active push that
   recommends items of potential interest to users based on their
   preferences. Equipped with an efficient dynamic query interface against
   a large-scale corpus, VisIRR organizes the retrieved documents into
   high-level topics and visualizes them in a 2D space, representing the
   relationships among the topics along with their keyword summary. In
   addition, based on interactive personalized preference feedback with
   regard to documents, VisIRR provides document recommendations from the
   entire corpus, which are beyond the retrieved sets. Such recommended
   documents are visualized in the same space as the retrieved documents,
   so that users can seamlessly analyze both existing and newly recommended
   ones. This article presents novel computational methods, which make
   these integrated representations and fast interactions possible for a
   large-scale document corpus. We illustrate how the system works by
   providing detailed usage scenarios. Additionally, we present preliminary
   user study results for evaluating the effectiveness of the system.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATICS-BASEL}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The visual exploration of large and complex network structures remains a
   challenge for many application fields. Moreover, a growing number of
   real-world networks is multivariate and often interconnected with each
   other. Entities in a network may have relationships with elements of
   other related datasets, which do not necessarily have to be networks
   themselves, and these relationships may be defined by attributes that
   can vary greatly. In this work, we propose a comprehensive visual
   analytics approach that supports researchers to specify and subsequently
   explore attribute-based relationships across networks, text documents
   and derived secondary data. Our approach provides an individual search
   functionality based on keywords and semantically similar terms over the
   entire text corpus to find related network nodes. For examining these
   nodes in the interconnected network views, we introduce a new
   interaction technique, called Hub2Go, which facilitates the navigation
   by guiding the user to the information of interest. To showcase our
   system, we use a large text corpus collected from research papers listed
   in the visualization publication dataset that consists of 2752 documents
   over a period of 25 years. Here, we analyze relationships between
   various heterogeneous networks, a bag-of-words index and a word
   similarity matrix, all derived from the initial corpus and metadata.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION VISUALIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-90}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a workflow and tool that allows a flexible
   formation of hypotheses about text features and their combinations,
   which are significantly connected in time to quantitative phenomena
   observed in stock data. To support such an analysis, we combine the
   analysis steps of frequent quantitative and text-oriented data using an
   existing a priori method. First, based on heuristics, we extract
   interesting intervals and patterns in large time series data. The visual
   analysis supports the analyst in exploring parameter combinations and
   their results. The identified time series patterns are then input for
   the second analysis step, in which all identified intervals of interest
   are analyzed for frequent patterns co-occurring with financial news. An
   a priori method supports the discovery of such sequential temporal
   patterns. Then, various text features such as the degree of sentence
   nesting, noun phrase complexity, and the vocabulary richness, are
   extracted from the news items to obtain meta-patterns. Meta-patterns are
   defined by a specific combination of text features which significantly
   differ from the text features of the remaining news data. Our approach
   combines a portfolio of visualization and analysis techniques, including
   time, cluster, and sequence visualization and analysis functionality. We
   provide a case study and an evaluation on financial data where we
   identify important future work. The workflow could be generalized to
   other application domains such as data analysis of smart grids, cyber
   physical systems, or the security of critical infrastructure, where the
   data consist of a combination of quantitative and textual time series
   data.}},

Title = {{Using a model of verbal art to analyse the visual: Analysing multimodal
   texts in secondary English}},
Journal = {{ENGLISH IN AUSTRALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{32-40}},
Abstract = {{Multimodal texts are now part of the curriculum for school English, but
   they are by their nature inherently complex, and pose many challenges
   for the classroom. Not least is finding a way to manage the technical
   complexity of accounting for these texts, as well as finding a way to
   move students beyond simple observation and description to critical
   analysis. In this paper, I show a strategy from a tertiary-level course
   which addresses both these problems. Using two Australian Defence Force
   recruiting videos from different eras, analysis is based on a
   social-semiotic model for multimodal texts, albeit a version of it which
   is `good enough' for the task at hand. By drawing on Hasan's notions of
   `verbal art', I show the steps that help to move students beyond
   description, towards critical analysis. While the tertiary context is
   different to that of schooling, the strategies can be applied at any
   teaching level.}},

Title = {{Exploring Digitised Moving Image Collections: The SEMIA Project, Visual
   Analysis and the Turn to Abstraction}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, efforts to unlock digitized moving image collections
   have focused primarily on the retrieval of collection items through
   semantic descriptors: keywords or other labels produced either manually,
   or as (semi-)automatically generated metadata. As a result, access to
   digital archives is still governed overwhelmingly by a logic of search.
   In practice, this means that users not only need to know what they are
   looking for, but are also constrained by the interpretive frameworks
   informing the materials' labelling. Arguably, this poses restrictions on
   what they can find, how they can interrelate collection objects, and
   ultimately, how they can reuse or reinterpret collections. Taking such
   issues as its starting point, the Sensory Moving Image Archive project
   (SEMIA) investigated how visual analysis tools can help enable more
   exploratory forms of engaging with digital archives. In doing so, it
   focused on sensory features, which are essential to users' experiences
   of audiovisual heritage objects but inadequately captured by verbal
   description.
   In this article, we discuss the project's rationale and its early
   results. First, we place SEMIA in a recent history of visual analysis
   for media scholarly research, specifying how it both builds on and
   departs from this history (also in the epistemic sense). Subsequently,
   we provide more details about the project's approach to image feature
   extraction and discuss some analysis results. In our conclusions, we
   confront those results with what we had initially hoped to gain by
   applying computer vision methods for enabling access to collections.yy}},

Abstract = {{Several stakeholder categorisation frameworks have been proposed in the
   literature. Although the triple intersecting circles representation -of
   power, urgency and legitimacy - is the most used, it has the limitation
   of any categorisation technique: a stakeholder can only belong to a
   predefined category and there can be no indication of a personalised
   profile that had not been identified a priori. To solve these issues, we
   propose a new framework based on fuzzy logic and visual analytics, which
   is capable of precisely assessing stakeholders' importance by indicating
   the exact degree of membership to a particular interest group. As an
   illustrative case study, this framework has been applied to construct
   and visualise the profile of key extractive sector stakeholders and
   measure their salience in a corporate social responsibility context.
   Results indicate that management and community have the highest
   salience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   derive insights from it. Based on LDA topic modelling algorithm, latent
   ``topics{''}, referred as issues in this paper, were discovered from the
   speech transcripts and visualized using `pyLDAvis', which is an
   interactive visualization tool used upon LDA Model results. Along with
   LDA, graphical visualizations were generated such as Lexical Dispersion
   Plots and `Topic Bar Plots using Matplotlib library of Python. Within
   comparative analytics, visual graphs were generated for speeches by two
   different candidates and juxtaposed to compare and interpret their
   discourse. Linguists have performed Political Discourse Analysis (PDA)
   using manual approaches but analyzing such a large volume of speeches is
   practically time consuming and extremely complex. Our experiment which
   focuses on identifying socio-political issues within speech transcripts
   using NLP based text analytics proves to be a beneficial technique for
   understanding Political Discourse Analysis (PDA).}},

   this approach may be inadequate because sports fans may be unlikely to
   mention a corporate sponsor in the text they tweet. This study
   demonstrates the use of visual analytics to assess conversations about
   corporate sponsors by examining the images people tweet.}},

Abstract = {{Mango is a globally important tropical fruit but lacks genomic tools to
   support cultivar identification and to enable breeding efforts.
   Assessing the genetic diversity and relatedness of mango germplasm is
   essential for identifying genetically distant parents with favorable
   agronomic traits to produce hybrid populations enabling selection of
   improved cultivars. We thus genotyped 1915 mango accessions from the
   United States, Senegal, Thailand, and Australia with 272 single
   nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identifying over 520,000
   genotypes. These accessions represent the available diversity from both
   public and private germplasm collections in these countries, as well as
   accessions from smaller international collections. The study included
   Mangifera indica, other Mangifera species, and accessions from half
   sibling populations. Genotype data were analyzed using an affinity
   propagation method to define 258 groups. Using a simple visual method,
   no more than 30 SNPs are needed to distinguish a single cultivar of
   interest from all other cultivars in the dataset enabling the accurate
   identification of important commercial cultivars. As these SNP markers
   provided accurate genotype data for accessions from different genera as
   well as half siblings, the majority of the genetic diversity of the
   mango germplasm and related species that were genotyped has been
   captured. The dataset contains a large collection of open-pollinated
   half siblings from known maternal parents. A simple visual method can
   also be used to identify self-pollinated individuals among the half
   siblings of known maternal parents and, in some cases, to infer likely
   candidates for the paternal parent. Identification of self-pollinated
   individuals is particularly important in terms of selection of improved
   cultivars, as due to high levels of heterozygosity, self-pollinated
   progeny are likely to uncover deleterious recessive alleles. Genotyping
   of progeny at the seedling stage and removal of self-pollinated progeny
   can increase the efficiency and decrease the costs of selection of
   improved cultivars from open-pollinated populations.}},

   such tools assists Arabic language analysts to effectively explore,
   understand, and discover interesting knowledge hidden in text data. We
   used statistical techniques from the field of Information Retrieval to
   identify the relevant documents coupled with sophisticated natural
   language processing (NLP) tools to process the text. For text
   visualization, the system used a hybrid approach combining latent
   semantic indexing for feature selection and multidimensional scaling for
   dimensionality reduction. Initial results confirm the viability of using
   this approach to tackle the problem of Arabic text visualization and
   other Arabic NLP applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose TRIVIR, a novel interactive visualization tool
   powered by an Information Retrieval (IR) engine that implements an
   active learning protocol to support IR with high recall. The system
   integrates multiple graphical views in order to assist the user
   identifying the relevant documents in a collection, including a
   content-based similarity map obtained with multi-dimensional projection
   techniques. Given representative documents as queries, users can
   interact with the views to label documents as relevant/not relevant, and
   this information is used to train a machine learning (ML) algorithm
   which suggests other potentially relevant documents on demand. TRIVIR
   offers two major advantages over existing visualization systems for IR.
   First, it merges the ML algorithm output into the visualization, while
   supporting several user interactions in order to enhance and speed up
   its convergence. Second, it tackles the problem of vocabulary mismatch,
   by providing term's synonyms and a view that conveys how the terms are
   used within the collection. Besides, TRIVIR has been developed as a
   flexible front-end interface that can be associated with distinct text
   representations and multidimensional projection techniques. We describe
   two use cases conducted with collaborators who are potential users of
   TRIVIR. Results show that the system simplified the search for relevant
   documents in large collections, based on the context in which the terms
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{Fusion research is an international collaboration work. To enable
   researchers across the world to visualize and analyze the experiment
   data, a web based data access and visualization tool is quite important
   {[}11. Now, a new WebScope based on RIA (Rich Internet Application) is
   designed and implemented to meet these requirements.
   On the browser side, a fluent and intuitive interface is provided for
   researchers at J-TEXT laboratory and collaborators from all over the
   world to view experiment data and related metadata. The fusion
   experiments will feature long pulse and high sampling rate in the
   future. The data access and visualization system in this work has
   adopted segment and scale concept. Large data samples are re-sampled in
   different scales and then split into segments for instant response. It
   allows users to view extremely large data on the web browser
   efficiently, without worrying about the limitation on the size of the
   data. The HTML5 and JavaScript based web front-end can provide intuitive
   and fluent user experience. On the server side, a RESTful
   (Representational State Transfer) web API, which is based on ASP.NET MVC
   (Model View Controller), allows users to access the data and its
   metadata through HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). An interface to the
   database has been designed to decouple the data access and visualization
   system from the data storage. It can be applied upon any data storage
   system like MDSplus or JTEXTDB, and this system is very easy to deploy
   as well.
   A WebScope with data provider both for MDSplus and JTEXTDB is
   implemented and deployed. The WebScope has been integrated into J-TEXT
   LogBook, an experimental recording system for J-TEXT. It is now serving
   J-TEXT daily experiment. In the future more databases as the data source
   will be supported and it will support visualization of more data types
   besides waveform. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a sound collection system to visualize environmental
   sounds that are collected using a crowd sourcing approach. An analysis
   of physical features is generally used to analyze sound properties;
   however, human beings not only analyze but also emotionally connect to
   sounds. If we want to visualize the sounds according to the
   characteristics of the listener, we need to collect not only the raw
   sound, but also the subjective feelings associated with them. For this
   purpose, we developed a sound collection system using a crowdsourcing
   approach to collect physical sounds, their statistics, and subjective
   evaluations simultaneously. We then conducted a sound collection
   experiment using the developed system on ten participants. We collected
   6,257 samples of equivalent loudness levels and their locations, and 516
   samples of sounds and their locations. Subjective evaluations by the
   participants are also included in the data. Next, we tried to visualize
   the sound on a map. The loudness levels are visualized as a color map
   and the sounds are visualized as icons which indicate the sound type.
   Finally, we conducted a discrimination experiment on the sound to
   implement a function of automatic conversion from sounds to appropriate
   icons. The classifier is trained on the basis of the GMM-UBM (Gaussian
   Mixture Model and Universal Background Model) method. Experimental
   results show that the F-measure is 0.52 and the AUC is 0.79.}},

Abstract = {{In psychological counseling, beginner counselors tend to force the
   client the interpretation by the counselor himself. Therefore, the
   amount of utterance by the beginner conselor become larger than that of
   the client and use the closed-ended question at high rates to confirm
   the image of the client created with their own interests. The
   opportunity of education is referred to as the supervision that expert
   counselors advice for beginner counselors is provided. However, the
   verbatim record of conversation documents in counseling used in the
   supervision are large-scale and complex. Expert counselors is very
   difficult to extract the characteristics and situation of conversation
   between the beginner counselor and the client. To improve the problem,
   we proposed the system for visualizing the conversation documents in the
   psychological counseling. Next, we evaluated to use this system by some
   counselors to verify the effectiveness of this proposed system. From
   this evaluation, the results were obtained from most estimators that
   these visualization results have a high tendency to be easily
   understandable. Moreover, we conducted the comparative evaluation by
   working the same task in the cases of reading only the original text and
   the use of this proposed system for the conversation documents in actual
   counseling. As the results, we showed that the task using this proposed

Abstract = {{It is an important research content to quickly obtain farmland
   information in precision and intelligent agriculture. Using low-altitude
   multi-rotor technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could help for the
   rapid collection of real-time farmland information. This paper builds a
   platform to manage the farmland crop information collected by
   multi-rotor UAV. Based on the Django framework, designs an information
   server system for field crop information collection, and collects the
   positioning data and sensor data from agricultural UAV in real time.
   Then, the data is analyzed and recorded in the database. The database is
   used to manage the collected crop data. The data can be downloaded and
   saved locally from the system. And the crop growth information can be
   directly reflected in the system to achieve visualization. (C) 2018,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a corpus that offers rich and authentic knowledge
   for Juz' Amma using the ontological engineering approach. The reason of
   the study conducted is because of lack of understanding of Juz' Amma in
   the form of listing result. At the same time, the listing result does
   not provide pictorial tidings for clustering the listing result.
   Therefore, the corpus covers knowledge from various authentic sources,
   including translation, annotation of keywords, tafsir, and related
   hadiths for every verse in English and Malay. The ontology is engineered
   and designed to effectively utilize the authentic knowledge extracted
   from the corpus intended to serve a dialogue-based information
   visualization system for Quranic text. A standard ontology engineering
   methodology was applied for developing the ontology. After creation, the
   ontology was evaluated and was found to fulfill the goals for which it
   was developed. The corpus and ontology are hoped to aid various semantic
   applications related to Quranic text in the future.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},

Abstract = {{Reading is a complex process that involves low-level visual processing,
   phonological processing, and higher-level semantic processing. Given
   that skilled reading requires integrating information among these
   different systems, it is likely that reading difficulty known as
   dyslexia can emerge from impairments at any stage of the reading
   circuitry. To understand contributing factors to reading difficulties
   within individuals, it is necessary to diagnose the function of each
   component of the reading circuitry. Here, we investigated whether adults
   with dyslexia who have impairments in visual processing respond to a
   visual manipulation specifically targeting their impairment. We
   collected psychophysical measures of visual crowding and tested how each
   individual's reading performance was affected by increased text-spacing,
   a manipulation designed to alleviate severe crowding. Critically, we
   identified a sub-group of individuals with dyslexia showing elevated
   crowding and found that these individuals read faster when text was
   rendered with increased letter-, word- and line-spacing. Our findings
   point to a subtype of dyslexia involving elevated crowding and
   demonstrate that individuals benefit from interventions personalized to
   their specific impairments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Text visualisations provide visual representations of documents or small

   interested in developing a more playful approach to language that can be
   characterised by the notion of wandering as an open-ended movement. To
   support such a casual form of engagement with text, we designed the
   WordWanderer system: a visualisation technique that extends tag clouds
   into a navigational interface for text. The tool supports the gradual
   movement between word `context views', which represent the words that
   co-occur in the vicinity of the selected word, and word-'comparison
   views', which arrange words based on their association strengths between
   two selected words. We report on the encouraging feedback from a ten-day
   deployment of the interface and present promising directions for future
   design and research.}},

   in data mining. It contains applications a well-known as extracting the
   documents consisting of description of similar semantics. The concept of
   finding similar semantics helps in clustering the documents. Clustering
   is a move and intensely complicated research area for obtaining the

   The Ant algorithms were stimulated by observations of trustworthy ant
   colonies. In this algorithm, the force of ant is around random. Because
   of the randomness reaction of the ant, the efficiency of algorithm can
   be increased. The ant uses the work of genius as picking up and dropping

Abstract = {{Data growth is enormously higher today and difficult to handle in an
   organized manner and in effective time limit. In data mining, a wide
   range of research is available for managing data effectively. Similarly,
   document clustering is one of the notable firm process in the data

   generate an algorithm for clustering by means of Adaptive Pillar K-means
   and Gaussian Firefly Algorithm (GFA). For determining the proper
   centroid in order to attain the proper clustered documents, Adaptive
   Pillar K-means Algorithm is utilized. Subsequently, GFA is exploited for
   the optimization process and also for enhancing the precision that
   results in reducing the sum of squared errors and computational time.
   Here, the performance of the proposed methodology is compared with
   various algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Ant colony optimization,
   and gravity clustering. The attained results shows the performance of
   the proposed methodology and the simulation results illustrated the
   betterment in quality with low sum of squared errors.}},

Abstract = {{Current visual question answering datasets do not consider the rich
   semantic information conveyed by text within an image. In this work, we
   present a new dataset, ST-VQA, that aims to highlight the importance of
   exploiting high-level semantic information present in images as textual
   cues in the Visual Question Answering process. We use this dataset to
   define a series of tasks of increasing difficulty for which reading the
   scene text in the context provided by the visual information is
   necessary to reason and generate an appropriate answer. We propose a new
   evaluation metric for these tasks to account both for reasoning errors
   as well as shortcomings of the text recognition module. In addition we
   put forward a series of baseline methods, which provide further insight
   to the newly released dataset, and set the scene for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Digitalization is changing how research is carried out in all areas of
   science. Humanities is no exception materials that used to be
   hand-written or printed on paper are increasingly available in digital
   form. This development is changing how scholars are interacting with
   their material.
   We are addressing the problem of interactive text visualization in the
   context of sociolinguistic language study. When a scholar is reading and
   analyzing text from a computer screen instead of a paper, we can support
   this by providing a dashboard for reading, and by creating
   visualizations of the text structure, variation, and change.
   We have designed and developed a software tool called Text Variation
   Explorer (TVE) for sociolinguistic language study. It is based on
   interactive visualization with a direct manipulation user interface, and
   aimed for exploratory corpus linguistics.
   The TVE software tool has proven to be useful in supporting the study of
   language variation and change in its social contexts, or
   sociolinguistics. It is, to a certain degree, language-independent, and
   generic enough to be useful in other linguistic contexts as well.
   We are now in the process of designing and implementing the next
   iteration of TVE. We present the lessons learned from the first version,
   discuss the old and the new design, and welcome feedback from the
   communities involved.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering problem (TCP) is a leading process in many key areas
   such as information retrieval, text mining, and natural language
   processing. This presents the need for a potent document clustering
   algorithm that can be used effectively to navigate, summarize, and
   arrange information to congregate large data sets. This paper
   encompasses an adaptation of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) for TCP,
   referred to as TCP-GWO. The TCP demands a degree of accuracy beyond that
   which is possible with metaheuristic swarm-based algorithms. The main
   issue to be addressed is how to split text documents on the basis of GWO
   into homogeneous clusters that are sufficiently precise and functional.
   Specifically, TCP-GWO, or referred to as the document clustering
   algorithm, used the average distance of documents to the cluster
   centroid (ADDC) as an objective function to repeatedly optimize the
   distance between the clusters of the documents. The accuracy and
   efficiency of the proposed TCP-GWO was demonstrated on a sufficiently
   large number of documents of variable sizes, documents that were
   randomly selected from a set of six publicly available data sets.
   Documents of high complexity were also included in the evaluation
   process to assess the recall detection rate of the document clustering
   algorithm. The experimental results for a test set of over a part of
   1300 documents showed that failure to correctly cluster a document
   occurred in less than 20\% of cases with a recall rate of more than 65\%
   for a highly complex data set. The high F-measure rate and ability to
   cluster documents in an effective manner are important advances
   resulting from this research. The proposed TCP-GWO method was compared
   to the other well-established text clustering methods using randomly
   selected data sets. Interestingly, TCP-GWO outperforms the comparative
   methods in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure rates. In a
   nutshell, the results illustrate that the proposed TCP-GWO is able to
   excel compared to the other comparative clustering methods in terms of
   measurement criteria, whereby more than 55\% of the documents were
   correctly clustered with a high level of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, text mining and visualization technology is applied to
   extract valuable information otherwise buried in the dense and abstract

   such key information from a text automatically, the Term Frequency
   Inverse Document Frequency algorithm was optimized to the
   characteristics of engineering texts. The key messages extracted from a
   case study construction report text in the form of keywords/terms were
   then visualized using a tag cloud algorithm. Questionnaires completed by
   construction managers then demonstrated that the proposed information
   visualization framework can facilitate rapid and informative access to
   key project information. This framework can thus reduce the workload and
   time required for construction managers to ascertain and act upon the

Abstract = {{Searching for similar documents has a crucial role in document
   management. Because of tremendous increase in documents day by day, it
   is very essential to segregate these documents in proper clusters.
   Faster categorization of documents is required in forensic investigation
   but analysis of these documents is very difficult. So, there is a need
   to separate multiple collections of documents into similar ones through
   clustering. Specifying number of clusters is mandatory in existing
   partitioning algorithms and the output is totally dependent on given
   input. Over clustering is the major problem in document clustering. The
   proposed algorithm takes input as Keywords found after extraction and
   solves the problem of over clustering by dividing the documents into
   small groups using Divide and Conquer Strategy. In this paper, an
   Improved Document Clustering algorithm is given which generates number
   of clusters for any text documents and uses cosine similarity measures
   to place similar documents in proper clusters. Experimental results
   showed that accuracy of proposed algorithm is high compare to existing
   algorithm in terms of F-Measure and time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of typical fault cases accumulated in the informatization
   work of State Grid Corporation of China are mostly descriptive text
   data, which is difficult to understand and analyze by means of
   automation. In view of this problem, text mining technology is used to
   extract fault problems and causes from fault cases to form the causal
   relationship of faults, so as to provide necessary conditions for the
   next step of fault text mining. This system uses the method of text
   clustering for fault location and auxiliary research. First of all,do
   the segmentation of fault information and processing scheme, in this
   step, the Chinese word segmentation is carried out by using the Jieba
   word segmentation tool. Secondly, it is necessary to clean the
   segmentation results and build a corpus. Thirdly, in order to represent
   the corpus as the type that the computer can calculate the similarity,
   we need to transform the corpus into frequency matrix. And then instead
   of using traditional k-means clustering algorithm to cluster, we use the
   calinski\_harabaz score to evaluate the best value of K. Finally, we put
   this model into application in actual production, build the fault
   information and solution mapping table.}},

Abstract = {{Information visualizations are often evaluated as a tool in terms of
   their ability to support performance of a specific task. This article
   argues that value can be gained by instead evaluating visualizations
   from a conununicative perspective. Specifically, it explores how text
   visualization can influence the impacts that framing has on the
   perception of political issues. Using data from a controlled laboratory
   study, the results presented here demonstrate that exposure to a text
   visualization can mitigate framing effects. Furthermore, it also shows a
   transfer effect, where participants who saw the visualization remained
   uninfluenced by framing in subsequent texts, even when the visualization
   was absent. These results carry implications for the methods used to
   evaluate information visualization systems, for understanding the
   cognitive and interpretive mechanisms by which framing effects occur,
   and for exploring the design space of interactive text visualization.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is devoted to the issue of clustering short texts, which are
   free answers gathered during brain storming seminars. Those answers are
   short, often incomplete, and highly biased toward the question, so
   establishing a notion of proximity between texts is a challenging task.
   In addition, the number of answers is counted up to hundred instances,
   which causes sparsity. We present three text clustering methods in order
   to choose the best one for this specific task, then we show how the
   method can be improved by a semantic enrichment, including neural-based
   distributional models and external knowledge resources. The algorithms
   have been evaluated on the unique seminar's data sets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel corpus-based enrichment approach for
   short text clustering. Since sparseness brings about the problem of
   insufficient word co-occurrence and lack of context information,
   previous researches use external sources such as Wikipedia or WordNet to
   enrich the representation of short text documents, which requires extra
   resources and might lead to possible inconsistency. On the other hand,
   corpus-based approaches use no external information in mining short text
   data. By introducing a set of conjugate definitions to characterize the
   structures of topics and words, and by proposing a virtual generative
   procedure for short texts, we perform expansion on short text data.
   Specifically, new words which may not appear in a short text document
   were added with a virtual term frequency, and this virtual frequency is
   obtained from the posterior probabilities of new words given all the
   words in that document. The complete procedure can be regarded as
   mapping data points (documents) from the original feature space to a
   hidden semantic space (topic space). After performing semantic
   smoothing, data points are then mapped back to the original space. We
   conduct experiments on two short text datasets, and the results show
   that the proposed method can effectively address the sparseness problem.
   For these datasets, our method, using only a basic clustering algorithm,
   attains a comparable performance with methods based on enrichment with
   external information sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Text clustering is widely used to create clusters of the digital
   documents. Selection of cluster centers plays an important role in the
   clustering. In this paper, we use artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC)
   to select appropriate cluster centers for creating clusters of the text
   documents. The ABC is a population-based nature-inspired algorithm,
   which simulates intelligent foraging behavior of the real honey bees and
   has been shown effective in solving many search and optimization
   problems. However, a major drawback of the algorithm is that it provides
   a good exploration of the search space at the cost of exploitation. In
   this paper, we improve search equation of the ABC and embed two local
   search paradigms namely chaotic local search and gradient search in the
   basic ABC to improve its exploitation capability. The proposed algorithm
   is named as chaotic gradient artificial bee colony. The effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithm is tested on three different benchmark text
   datasets namely Reuters-21,578, Classic4, and WebKB. The obtained
   results are compared with the ABC, a recent variant of the ABC namely
   gbest-guided ABC, a variant of the proposed methodology namely chaotic
   artificial bee colony, memetic ABC, and conventional clustering
   algorithm K-means. The empirical evaluation reveals very encouraging
   results in terms of the quality of solution and convergence speed.}},

Abstract = {{Descriptive clustering consists of automatically organizing data
   instances into clusters and generating a descriptive summary for each
   cluster. The description should inform a user about the contents of each
   cluster without further examination of the specific instances, enabling
   a user to rapidly scan for relevant clusters. Selection of descriptions
   often relies on heuristic criteria. We model descriptive clustering as
   an auto-encoder network that predicts features from cluster assignments
   and predicts cluster assignments from a subset of features. The subset
   of features used for predicting a cluster serves as its description. For
   text documents, the occurrence or count of words, phrases, or other
   attributes provides a sparse feature representation with interpretable
   feature labels. In the proposed network, cluster predictions are made
   using logistic regression models, and feature predictions rely on
   logistic or multinomial regression models. Optimizing these models leads
   to a completely self-tuned descriptive clustering approach that
   automatically selects the number of clusters and the number of features
   for each cluster. We applied the methodology to a variety of short text
   documents and showed that the selected clustering, as evidenced by the
   selected feature subsets, are associated with a meaningful topical
   organization.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic document clustering is a type of unsupervised learning in which
   documents are grouped together based on their meaning. Unlike
   traditional approaches that cluster documents based on common keywords,
   this technique can group documents that share no words in common as long
   as they are on the same subject. We compute the similarity between two
   documents as a function of the semantic similarity between the words and
   phrases in the documents. We model information from WordNet and DBPedia
   as a probabilistic graph that can be used to compute the similarity
   between two terms. We experimentally validate our algorithm on the
   Reuters-21578 benchmark, which contains 11, 362 newswire stories that
   are grouped in 82 categories using human judgment. We apply the k-means
   clustering algorithm to group the documents using a similarity metric
   that is based on keyword matching and one that uses the probabilistic
   graph. We show that the second approach produces higher precision and
   recall, which corresponds to better alignment with the classification
   that was done by human experts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an interactive document clustering system, which is
   designed based on the concept of CMV (coordinated multiple views). An
   interactive document clustering is used by a user to obtain a set of
   document groups from a document collection in interactive manner. It is
   expected to be useful for various tasks such as text mining and document
   retrieval. As the result of document clustering consists of multiple
   objects such as clusters (document groups), documents, and words, each
   of those should be presented to users in different ways. Based on this
   consideration, the proposed system employs multiple views, each of which
   is designed for specific object such as document and keyword. A
   prototype system is implemented on TETDM (Total Environment for Text
   Data Mining), which is one of environments for developing text data
   mining tools. As it can provide the mechanism of coordination between
   modules, we decided to use it for developing the prototype system. The
   proposed system classifies information to be presented into 4 levels:
   clusters, document, bag of words, and word, each of which is displayed
   with different views. Experimental results with test participants show
   the effectiveness of the proposed system.}},

   component analysis problem in a primal-dual optimization framework. The
   KSC model is built on a small subset of data using a proper training,
   model selection and a test phase. The clustering model is obtained using
   the dual solution of the problem and has a powerful out-of-sample
   extensions property which allows cluster affiliation for previously
   unseen data points. In the model selection phase, we estimate the
   appropriate number of clusters using a metric that evaluates the quality
   of the clusters. Traditional quality indices like inertia,
   Davies-Bouldin (DB) index and silhouette (SIL) are known to be
   method-dependent and not perform well in case of complex heterogeneous
   data like textual data. In this paper, we utilize the quality evaluation
   techniques based on an unsupervised version of Precision, Recall and
   F-measure proposed in {[}1] to come up with a new kernel spectral
   document clustering (KSDC) model which generates homogeneous clusters of
   documents. We compare the quality of the clusters obtained by the
   proposed KSDC technique with k-means and neural gas algorithm, which are
   more oriented towards these metrics, on several real world textual data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel document clustering algorithm that
   represents documents as a time series of words. Document clustering is
   very important due to the fact that it permits us to group them based on
   some certain criteria, especially nowadays when a large number of
   articles are available. The timed series representation of the document
   instead of the vector model permits us to consider a new algorithm for
   the computation of the distance between documents: dynamic time warping.
   This novel representation together with the dynamic time warping
   algorithm represents the foundation for computing the similarity and the
   clustering of the documents. The clustering algorithm used is
   hierarchical clustering. This novel clustering method of texts is
   applied on named entities and on the parts of speech of the words that
   compose the documents. As test data we are using the Reuters corpus of
   newspaper articles.}},

Abstract = {{Community detection is the process of extracting community structured
   subgraphs from community networks. Most research regarding community
   detection has focused on the network structure without taking the
   content associated with the nodes into account. In this paper, we
   propose a new method for enhancing a co-authorship network's structure
   using clustering. Specifically, considering the clustering process, we
   use a sequence with proved performance between the WordNet lemmatizer,
   Document Embeddings and Spherical K-Means, while choosing the Louvain
   algorithm for community detection. Thus, we improve the Louvain's
   community detection algorithm modularity by interconnecting the author
   nodes for the articles clustered together. To evaluate our method, we
   collected a dataset containing articles' abstracts and authors. The
   experimental results show that our method suggests potential new
   collaborations by adding vertices to the graph after analysing the

   many applications, such as root-cause analysis of spam campaigns, as
   well as identifying common topics in social media. Due to the sheer size

   work, we present our approach for text clustering that builds an
   approximate k-NN graph, which is then used to compute connected
   components representing clusters. Our focus is to understand the
   scalability / accuracy tradeoff that underlies our method: we do so
   through an extensive experimental campaign, where we use real-life
   datasets, and show that even rough approximations of k-NN graphs are
   sufficient to identify valid clusters. Our method is scalable and can be
   easily tuned to meet requirements stemming from different application

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a document clustering method based on Sparse
   Topical Coding, called Cluster-based Sparse Topical Coding. Topic
   modeling is capable of improving textual document clustering by
   describing documents via bag-of-words models and projecting them into a
   topic space. The latent semantic descriptions derived by the topic model
   can be utilized as features in a clustering process. In our proposed
   method, document clustering and topic modeling are integrated in a
   unified framework in order to achieve the highest performance. This
   framework includes Sparse Topical Coding, which is responsible for topic
   mining, and K-means that discovers the latent clusters in documents
   collection. Experimental results on widely-used datasets show that our
   proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional and other
   topic model based clustering methods. Our method achieves from 4 to 39\%
   improvement in clustering accuracy and from 2\% to more than 44\%

Title = {{Hierarchical Dirichlet Multinomial Allocation Model for Multi-Source
   Document Clustering}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{109917-109927}},
Abstract = {{Mining a document structure from multiple data sources in terms of their
   underlying topics has become an important task of document clustering.
   The traditional document clustering approach cannot be applied directly
   to the multi-source document clustering problem. There are three typical
   difficulties: 1) The topics of different data sources are related but
   not the same. 2) Usually, each data source has its own focus on topics.
   3) The number of clusters of the data sources are not necessarily the
   same and are not known beforehand. In this paper, based on our previous
   research, we design a novel multi-source document clustering model,
   namely, the hierarchical Dirichlet multinomial allocation (HDMA) model,
   to solve all the above problems. The HDMA model is investigated with a
   two-step hierarchical topic generation process. Topics are learnt to
   share their general characteristics across data source, while at the
   same time preserve the local characteristics of the data source. Each
   data source is applied with an exclusive topic partition to learn the
   source-level topic emphasis. A Gibbs sampling algorithm is then used to
   learn the number of clusters for each data source as well as the
   parameters of the HDMA model at the same time. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the HDMA model is effective.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis process of document content and its visualization play a
   basic role in the context of knowledge representation and retrieval.
   Existing methods for tag-clouds generations are mostly based on text
   content of documents, others also consider statistical or semantic
   information to enrich the document summary, while precious information
   deriving from multimedia content is often neglected. In this paper we
   present a document summarization and visualization technique based on
   both statistical and semantic analysis of textual and visual contents.
   The result of our framework is a Visual Semantic Tag Cloud based on the
   highlighting of relevant terms in a document using some features (font
   size, color, etc.) showing the importance of a term compared to other
   ones. The semantic information is derived from a knowledge base where
   concepts are represented through several multimedia items. The Visual
   Semantic Tag Cloud can be used not only to synthesize a document but
   also to represent a set of documents grouped by categories using a topic
   detection technique based on textual and visual analysis of multimedia
   features. Our work aims at demonstrating that with the help of semantic
   analysis and the combination of textual and visual features it is
   possible to improve the user knowledge acquisition by means of a
   synthesized visualization. The whole strategy has been evaluated by
   means of a ground truth and compared with similar approaches.
   Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach, which
   outperforms state-of-art algorithms in topic detection combining both
   visual and semantic information.}},

Abstract = {{When security incidents occur in a cloud computing environment, it
   constitutes a wake-up call to acknowledge potential threats and risks.
   Compared to other types of incidents (e.g., extreme climate events,
   terror attacks and natural disasters), incidents pertaining to the cloud
   security issues seem to receive little attention from academia. This
   study aims to provide a starting point for further studies via
   analytics. Bayesian change-point analysis, often employed to detect
   abrupt regime shifts in a variety of events, was performed to identify
   the salient changes in the cloud incident count data retrieved from
   Cloutage.org database. Additionally, to get to the root of such
   incidents, this study utilized text mining techniques with word clouds
   to visualize non-obvious patterns in the summaries of cloud incidents.
   Both quantitative and qualitative analyses for exploring cloud incident
   data offer new insights in finding commonality and differences among the
   causes of cloud vulnerabilities over time.}},

Abstract = {{Patents are a type of intellectual property rights that provide
   exclusive rights to the invention. Whenever there is a novelty or an
   invention, prior art search on patents is carried out to check the
   degree of innovation. Clustering is used to group the relevant documents
   of prior art search to gain insights about the patent document. The
   patent documents represent hundreds of features (words extracted from
   the title and abstract fields). The common sets of features between the
   documents are subtle. Therefore, the number of features for clustering
   increases drastically. This leads to the curse of dimensionality. Hence,
   in thiswork, dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and SVD are
   employed to compare and analyze the quality of clusters formed from the
   Google patent documents. This comparative analysiswas performed by
   considering title, abstract, and classification code fields of the
   patent document. Classification code information was used to decide the
   number of clusters.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel concept factorization (CF) method, called CF with
   adaptive neighbors (CFANs), is proposed. The idea of CFAN is to
   integrate an ANs regularization constraint into the CF decomposition.
   The goal of CFAN is to extract the representation space that maintains
   geometrical neighborhood structure of the data. Similar to the existing
   graph-regularized CF, CFAN builds a neighbor graph weights matrix. The
   key difference is that the CFAN performs dimensionality reduction and
   finds the neighbor graph weights matrix simultaneously. An efficient
   algorithm is also derived to solve the proposed problem. We apply the
   proposed method to the problem of document clustering on the 20
   Newsgroups, Reuters-21578, and TDT2 document data sets. Our experiments
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is being used in different fields of research, including data
   mining, taxonomy, document retrieval, image segmentation, pattern
   classification. Text clustering is a technique through which text/
   documents are divided into a particular number of groups, so that text
   within each group is related in contents. In this paper, the idea of
   ensemble text clustering of majority voting is defined. For this
   purpose, different clustering methods such as fuzzy c-means, k-means,
   agglomerative, Gustafson Kessel and k-medoid are used. After performing
   the pre-processing of the documents, inverse document frequency (IDF)
   has been achieved by the provided dataset. The achieved IDF is
   considered as input to the clustering algorithms. Dunn Index and Davies
   Bouldin Index have been calculated which are applied to analyze the
   usefulness of the proposed ensemble clustering. In this work, a dataset
   ``Textclus{''} which contains four different classes, history,
   education, politician and art as a text is applied. Additionally,
   another dataset ``20newsgroups{''} is also applied for analysis. The
   clustering quality measures have also been calculated from the proposed
   ensemble clustering results. The attained results show that the proposed
   ensemble clustering outperforms the other state of the art clustering

Abstract = {{Properties of corpora, such as the diversity of vocabulary and how
   tightly related texts cluster together, impact the best way to cluster
   short texts. We examine several such properties in a variety of corpora
   and track their effects on various combinations of similarity metrics
   and clustering algorithms. We show that semantic similarity metrics
   outperform traditional n-gram and dependency similarity metrics for
   k-means clustering of a linguistically creative dataset, but do not help
   with less creative texts. Yet the choice of similarity metric interacts
   with the choice of clustering method. We find that graph-based
   clustering methods perform well on tightly clustered data but poorly on
   loosely clustered data. Semantic similarity metrics generate loosely
   clustered output even when applied to a tightly clustered dataset. Thus,
   the best performing clustering systems could not use semantic metrics.}},

   Language Processing. It has good performance in many cases, especially
   in dealing with large data sets. However, how to choose the initial
   cluster centers is a hard problem, different choice may cause the
   clustering results by K-means unstable even get the local optimum. To
   solve this problem, many methods have be proposed, while these methods
   only apply in some certain fields and perform disappointed when we use
   for text documents clustering. In this paper, we designed a novel
   density K-means algorithm and apply it in the text document clustering.
   The experimental results show that it performs better than most of the
   existing methods in Chinese corpus. Furthermore, compared with other
   algorithms, our algorithm can effectively decrease the iterations.}},

   focuses on topic evolution over 10 years and on individual topics of
   cross domains. A hierarchical topic model is adopted to extract topics
   of three different domains and to correlate the extracted topics. A
   simple yet effective visualization interface is then designed, and

Abstract = {{Visual text analytics has recently emerged as one of the most prominent
   topics in both academic research and the commercial world. To provide an
   overview of the relevant techniques and analysis tasks, as well as the
   relationships between them, we comprehensively analyzed 263
   visualization papers and 4,346 mining papers published between 1992-2017
   in two fields: visualization and text mining. From the analysis, we
   derived around 300 concepts (visualization techniques, mining
   techniques, and analysis tasks) and built a taxonomy for each type of
   concept. The co-occurrence relationships between the concepts were also
   extracted. Our research can be used as a stepping-stone for other
   researchers to 1) understand a common set of concepts used in this
   research topic; 2) facilitate the exploration of the relationships
   between visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks;
   3) understand the current practice in developing visual text analytics
   tools; 4) seek potential research opportunities by narrowing the gulf
   between visualization and mining techniques based on the analysis tasks;
   and 5) analyze other interdisciplinary research areas in a similar way.
   We have also contributed a web-based visualization tool for analyzing

Abstract = {{Recent research results show that ontology can be used to improve the
   accuracy of document clustering. Previous studies mainly focused on the
   preprocessing part of text document using ontology. In this paper, we
   propose a hybrid approach, concentrating on both the preprocessing task
   as well as the clustering algorithm. This is with an objective of
   reducing the number of features and execution time, eliminate synonymous
   problems and enhance the accuracy of clustering. Cosine similarity is
   used as similarity measure. The preprocessing part uses a WordNet
   Ontology based feature extraction method. In clustering, the initial
   centroids are found by applying the Red Black Tree based sorting method.
   The data points are allocated to the suitable clusters using a novel
   approach, by maintaining the path of similarity between data points and
   nearest cluster centroids. Experimental results on some of the existing
   clustering algorithms with cosine similarity are compared with our novel
   clustering technique. Results show that the proposed hybrid approach
   executes better on the Newsgroup dataset with considerable improvements
   in dimensionality reduction, running time, and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we propose a game theoretic model for document clustering.
   Each document to be clustered is represented as a player and each
   cluster as a strategy. The players receive a reward interacting with
   other players that they try to maximize choosing their best strategies.
   The geometry of the data is modeled with a weighted graph that encodes
   the pairwise similarity among documents, so that similar players are
   constrained to choose similar strategies, updating their strategy
   preferences at each iteration of the games. We used different approaches
   to find the prototypical elements of the clusters and with this
   information we divided the players into two disjoint sets, one
   collecting players with a definite strategy and the other one collecting
   players that try to learn from others the correct strategy to play. The
   latter set of players can be considered as new data points that have to
   be clustered according to previous information. This representation is
   useful in scenarios in which the data are streamed continuously. The
   evaluation of the system was conducted on 13 document datasets using
   different settings. It shows that the proposed method performs well
   compared to different document clustering algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to support the
   creation of knowledge representations based on enriched Semantic
   Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with
   ontological support. One of the primary research challenges addressed
   here relates to the process of formalization and representation of
   document contents, where most existing approaches are limited and only
   take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document.
   This research explores how traditional knowledge representations can be
   enriched through incorporation of implicit information derived from the
   complex relationships (semantic associations) modelled by domain
   ontologies with the addition of information presented in documents. The
   relevant achievements pursued by this work are the following: (i)
   conceptualization of a model that enables the semantic enrichment of
   knowledge sources supported by domain experts; and (ii) implementation
   of a proof-of-concept, named SENSE (Semantic Enrichment knowledge
   Sources).}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the trending topics in journals and conferences is valuable
   for understanding the role of authors, institutions, and funding
   agencies in the progression of knowledge produced in the field. However,
   many available clustering methods do not accommodate a desire for
   temporally clustered results that are typical of trends, in part because
   time of publication is often neglected as a feature. As a demonstration
   of how time can be emphasized in trend detection, we use a novel
   approach of introducing a weighted temporal feature to bias a topic
   clustering toward articles in a similar time frame; this is performed
   over a set of finance journal abstracts from 1974 to 2020. Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to parameterize each abstract,
   followed by dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition
   (SVD). We detect trending finance topics that are not identifiable when
   we use a standard clustering approach with no temporal bias. To identify
   trending topics, we utilize a metric of the silhouette score divided by
   the standard deviation of clusters over time. We then isolate topics
   identified by this metric and validate them using expert judgment. Our
   clustering strategy using temporal bias can be readily utilized in other
   fields for discovering the rise and fall of trends.(c) 2021 The

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Document representation is central to modern natural language processing
   systems including document clustering. Empirical experiments in recent
   studies provide strong evidence that unsupervised language models can
   learn context-aware representations in the given documents and advance
   several NLP benchmark results. However, existing clustering approaches
   focus on the dimensionality reduction and do not exploit these
   informative representations. In this paper, we propose a conceptually
   simple but experimentally effective clustering framework called Advanced
   Document Clustering (ADC). In contrast to previous clustering methods,
   ADC is designed to leverage syntactically and semantically meaningful
   features through feature-extraction and clustering modules in the
   framework. We first extract features from pre-trained language models
   and initialize cluster centroids to spread out uniformly. In the
   clustering module of ADC, the semantic similarity can be measured using
   the cosine similarity and centroids update while assigning centroids to
   a mini-batch input. Also, we utilize cross entropy loss partially, as
   the self-training scheme can be biased when parameters in the model are
   inaccurate. As a result, ADC can take advantages of contextualized
   representations while mitigating the limitations introduced by
   high-dimensional vectors. In numerous experiments with four datasets,
   the proposed ADC outperforms other existing approaches. In particular,
   experiments on categorizing news corpus with fake news demonstrated the
   effectiveness of our method for contextualized representations. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{The performance of an IR system is deteriorated by factors including
   short and vague queries put up by the users, ever increasing volume of
   documents on the web, users not knowing their exact information need
   etc. Relevance feedback (RF) and web search document clustering are
   techniques to improve the performance of an Information Retrieval (IR)
   system. Relevance feedback provides a method to get more relevant search
   result from an IR system using documents that are marked relevant by the
   user as a feedback to reformulate query. This refined query is then used
   to retrieve the documents. In document clustering approach, the search
   result is divided into thematic groups where documents of one group are
   similar to each other and dissimilar to the documents of other groups.
   This paper presents a report on the effectiveness of relevance feedback
   technique as compared to document clustering in context of web
   information retrieval and why document clustering is the most preferred
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering has become an important task for processing the big
   amount of textual information available on the Internet. On the other
   hand, k-means is the most widely used algorithm for clustering, mainly
   due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, k-means becomes slow
   for large and high dimensional datasets, such as document collections.
   Recently the FPAC algorithm was proposed to mitigate this problem, but
   the improvement in the speed was reached at the cost of reducing the
   quality of the clustering results. For this reason, in this paper, we
   introduce an improved FPAC algorithm, which, according our experiments
   on different document collections, allows obtaining better clustering
   results than FPAC, without highly increasing the runtime.}},

   nowadays. In the microblog environment, content or the specific theme
   for tweets are identified using hashtags but in general, all tweets do

   microblogs, recommending relevant hashtags to tweets is emerging as a
   challenging task. This paper proposed an approach for short text
   clustering using temporal classification approaches. Hence for the batch
   of tweets both LDA and HDP topic modeling are attempted. In this paper,
   a hashtag is recommended for each tweet for mapping the topics obtained
   and the topic with the higher probability is considered as the hashtag

Abstract = {{Textual data frequently occurs as an unlabeled document collection,
   therefore it is useful to sort this collection into clusters of related
   documents. On the other hand, text has different aspects, which a single
   representation cannot capture. To this end, multi-view clustering
   present an efficient solution to integrate different representations
   called ``views{''} by exploiting the complementary characteristics of
   these views. However, the existing methods consider only one
   representation mode for all views that is based on terms frequencies.
   Such representation leads to losing valuable information and fails to
   capture the semantic aspect of text. To overcome these issues, we
   propose a new method for multi-view text clustering that exploits
   different representations of text in order to improve the quality of
   clustering. The experimental results show that the proposed method
   outperforms other methods and enhances the clustering quality.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of scientific and technical documents is crucial in the
   process of establishing science and technology strategies. One popular
   method for such analysis is for field experts to manually classify each
   scientific or technical document into one of several predefined
   technical categories. However, not only is manual classification
   error-prone and expensive, but it also requires extended efforts to
   handle frequent data updates. In contrast, machine learning and text
   mining techniques enable cheaper and faster operations, and can
   alleviate the burden on human resources. In this paper, we propose a
   method for extracting embedded feature vectors by applying a neural
   embedding approach for text features in patent documents and

Abstract = {{Clustering is one of the epic and traditional ways to make sure that the
   documents are retrieved at the right pace and according to the
   requirement. Clustering leads to keeping the similar kind of documents
   all together and so that they can be retrieved easily. The measure
   through which the relation between two documents is measured is called
   similarity index. There are several kind of similarity index already in
   the process. The proposed algorithm uses two kind of similarity index
   and combines them to produce a new similarity index. Similarity index
   plays a vital role in the clustering and classification procedure. The
   proposed algorithm also uses Fuzzy logic for the clustering rules and
   furthermore it is classified by the Support Vector Machine to justify
   the accuracy of the proposed solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new parallel algorithm for text document
   clustering based on the concept of neighbor (Guha et al. in Inf Syst
   25(5): 345-366, 2000). If two documents are similar enough, they are
   considered as neighbors of each other. The new algorithm is named
   parallel k-means based on neighbors (PKBN), and it is a parallel version
   of sequential k-means based on neighbors (SKBN) that we proposed in Luo
   et al. (Data Knowl Eng 68(11): 1271-1288, 2009). PKBN fully exploits the
   data-parallelism of SKBN and adopts a new parallel pair-generating
   method to build the neighbor matrix. Our new parallel pair-generating
   method causes less communication overhead between processors than
   existing methods. PKBN is designed for message-passing multiprocessor
   systems and is implemented on a cluster of Linux workstations to analyze
   its performance. Our experimental results on real-life data sets
   demonstrate that PKBN is very efficient and has good scalability with
   respect to the number of processors and the size of data set.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is used to organize the documents into groups. VSM
   (Vector Space Model) is a technique used to represent the document as a
   vector. Working with VSM to cluster the documents is easier.
   The main problem with text documents clustering is very high
   dimensionality of data. A term in the document represents a dimension.
   To reduce the dimensions of the document vector space, it is
   preprocessed. The main techniques involved are stemming and term
   filtering for dimensions reduction of document vectors. After dimensions
   reduction, term frequency vectors corresponding to each document are
   generated, where each cell in the term frequency vector represents
   frequencies of a term. Using proposed method in the paper, each pair of
   term frequency vectors are compared to find out the similarity value
   between every two corresponding documents. In this way, three similarity
   matrices minimum\_match, maximum\_match and average\_match are generated
   which are further used in various clustering techniques to produce
   clusters. Clusters produced using proposed approach are compared with
   that of clusters produced based on cosine similarity in terms of
   F-measure. Higher values of F-measure for clusters produced using
   proposed method shows that proposed algorithm is better.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of document clustering is about automatic grouping of text
   documents into groups containing similar documents. This problem under
   supervised setting yields good results whereas for unannotated data the
   unsupervised machine learning approach does not yield good results
   always. Algorithms like K-Means clustering are most popular when the
   class labels are not known. The objective of this work is to apply
   community discovery algorithms from the literature of social network
   analysis to detect the underlying groups in the text data.
   We model the corpus of documents as a graph with distinct non-trivial
   words from the whole corpus considered as nodes and an edge is added
   between two nodes if the corresponding word nodes occur together in at
   least one common document. Edge weight between two word nodes is defined
   as the number of documents in which those two words cooccur together. We
   apply the fast Louvain community discovery algorithm to detect
   communities. The challenge is to interpret the communities as classes.
   If the number of communities obtained is greater than the required
   number of classes, a technique for merging is proposed. The community
   which has the maximum number of similar words with a document is
   assigned as the community for that document. The main thrust of the
   paper is to show a novel approach to document clustering using community
   discovery algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a few bench
   mark data sets and we find that our algorithm gives competitive results
   on majority of the data sets when compared to the standard clustering
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Due to scientific progression, a variety of challenges exist in the
   field of information retrieval (IR). These challenges are due to the
   increased usage of large volumes of data. These enormous amounts of data
   are available from large-scale distributed networks. Centralization of
   these data to perform analysis is difficult. There exists a need for
   distributed text document clustering algorithms that overcomes
   challenges in clustering. The two main challenges are clustering
   accuracy and clustering quality. In this paper, an optimized distributed
   text document clustering algorithm is proposed that uses a distributed
   particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm for the purpose of
   optimizing and generating initial centroids for the distributed K-means
   (DKMeans) clustering algorithm. This improves the quality of clustering.
   Similarity is determined using Jaccard coefficient that generates
   coherent clusters, thus improving the accuracy of the proposed
   algorithm. Extensive evaluations based on simulation are carried out
   with the given data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   algorithm. Data sets such as Reuters-21578 and 20 Newsgroups are used

   The traditional K-means algorithm has sensitivity to the initial cluster

   proposes an improved K-means text clustering algorithm by optimizing
   initial cluster centers. The algorithm first calculates the density of
   each data object in the data set, and then judge which data object is an
   isolated point. After removing all of isolated points, a set of data
   objects with high density is obtained. Afterwards, chooses k high
   density data objects as the initial cluster centers, where the distance
   between the data objects is the largest. The experimental results show
   that the improved K-means algorithm can improve the stability and

   criterion) and the distance measure between the vectors of probabilities
   (quantitative criterion). We perform a structural analysis on the latent
   semantic space using the Pretopology theory that allows us to
   investigate the role of the number of clusters and the chosen centroids,
   in the similarity between the computed clusters. We have applied our
   method to Twitter data and showed the accuracy of our results compared
   to a random choice number of clusters.

Abstract = {{Clustering is an efficient data mining as well as machine-learning
   method when we need to get an insight of the objects of a dataset that
   could be grouped together. K-Means is one of the most commonly used
   methods of clustering, due to its high quality results and low time
   cost. However, using the K-Means algorithm in document clustering over
   large-scale collections can lead to unpredictable time costs, since
   duration of a K-Means iteration tends to grow as the number of
   iterations grows. In this paper we first present some of the most
   promising alternatives for document clustering over such `big data'
   (large-scale) collections. We also present our variation of an existing
   K-Means-based algorithm, known as BigKClustering (BKC) so that it can be
   applied in document clustering. The proposed adjustment of BKC is then
   implemented using Hadoop MapReduce to handle big (text) data collections
   efficiently and experimentally tested over a real cluster environment.
   As it comes out of the experiments, it leads to acceptable clustering
   quality as well as significant execution time improvements (compared to
   K-Means), thus constituting a promising clustering approach for big
   document collections.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations prefer using cloud for storing their data due to
   availability of cost-effective storage. The outsourced data include
   sensitive information, so data is encrypted as maintaining
   confidentiality and privacy of the documents is of paramount importance.
   Retrieving the desired information from the cloud requires efficient
   searching, which involves submission of search query to the cloud server
   by the end-user. As the search terms may include sensitive information
   of an organization, it is desired that the search query should not
   reveal any confidential information. The existing works are not suitable
   for big-data scenario due to high search time required for large
   document collections, thereby leading to increased cloud usage cost.
   Thus, an efficient approach to perform search on encrypted data using
   clustering is proposed in this paper. As the proposed technique clusters
   the documents based on the relationship between the keywords, the search
   method involves searching documents within the relevant cluster in
   contrast to searching the entire dataset. An efficient ranking method is
   incorporated to rank the documents according to the relevance to search
   query using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) value of
   the keywords in the documents, which leads to reduced communication
   overheads due to reduction in unnecessary documents being downloaded.
   Moreover, an efficient query randomization approach is proposed so that
   two or more queries involving the same search terms appear distinct.
   Experimental results using real datasets demonstrate that our proposed
   multi-keyword ranked search scheme on encrypted cloud data significantly
   reduce the number of comparisons and search time in comparison to the
   existing techniques while maintaining recall of 100\% and precision of
   82\%.}},

Abstract = {{With the ceaseless flourishing of the internet, the number of text
   documents in electronic form is increasing exorbitantly. Thus document
   clustering which organizes such large collections of documents into
   meaningful clusters has become an important technique. Traditional
   clustering methods cluster documents based on statistical features.
   Thus, documents clustered together using traditional clustering methods
   are not conceptually similar to one another as semantic relationships
   between documents are ignored. In this paper, a model for document
   clustering that groups documents with similar concepts together is
   introduced. Proposed model initially identifies all the coreferences in
   each of the documents in the collection. Polysemy and synonymy problems
   are tackled by capturing an appropriate sense of the word based on its
   context using the WordNet and the Semantic similarity. The proposed
   clustering model is implemented for the classic4 dataset and the results
   show an improvement in the efficiency.}},

Journal = {{COMPLEX \& INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{A massive amount of textual data now exists in digital repositories in
   the form of research articles, news articles, reviews, Wikipedia
   articles, and books, etc. Text clustering is a fundamental data mining
   technique to perform categorization, topic extraction, and information
   retrieval. Textual datasets, especially which contain a large number of
   documents are sparse and have high dimensionality. Hence, traditional
   clustering techniques such as K-means, Agglomerative clustering, and
   DBSCAN cannot perform well. In this paper, a clustering technique
   especially suitable to large text datasets is proposed that overcome
   these limitations. The proposed technique is based on word embeddings
   derived from a recent deep learning model named ``Bidirectional Encoders
   Representations using Transformers{''}. The proposed technique is named
   as WEClustering. The proposed technique deals with the problem of high
   dimensionality in an effective manner, hence, more accurate clusters are
   formed. The technique is validated on several datasets of varying sizes
   and its performance is compared with other widely used and state of the
   art clustering techniques. The experimental comparison shows that the
   proposed clustering technique gives a significant improvement over other
   techniques as measured by metrics such Purity and Adjusted Rand Index.}},

Title = {{World Knowledge as Indirect Supervision for Document Clustering}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in
   applications is the need to supervise them, a costly process that often
   requires hiring domain experts. We consider the framework to use the
   world knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is
   general-purpose knowledge, which is not designed for any specific
   domain. Then, the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to
   domains and how to represent it for learning. In this article, we
   provide an example of using world knowledge for domain-dependent
   document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the world
   knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and
   their types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a
   heterogeneous information network. Then, we propose a clustering
   algorithm that can cluster multiple types and incorporate the sub-type
   information as constraints. In the experiments, we use two existing
   knowledge bases as our sources of world knowledge. One is Freebase,
   which is collaboratively collected knowledge about entities and their
   organizations. The other is YAGO2, a knowledge base automatically
   extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge to the linguistic knowledge
   base, WordNet. Experimental results on two text benchmark datasets
   (20newsgroups and RCV1) show that incorporating world knowledge as
   indirect supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
   clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with
   world knowledge features.
   A preliminary version of this work appeared in the proceedings of KDD
   2015 {[}Wang et al. 2015a]. This journal version has made several major
   improvements. First, we have proposed a new and general learning
   framework for machine learning with world knowledge as indirect
   supervision, where document clustering is a special case in the original
   paper. Second, in order to make our unsupervised semantic parsing method
   more understandable, we add several real cases from the original
   sentences to the resulting logic forms with all the necessary
   information. Third, we add details of the three semantic filtering
   methods and conduct deep analysis of the three semantic filters, by
   using case studies to show why the conceptualization-based semantic
   filter can produce more accurate indirect supervision. Finally, in
   addition to the experiment on 20 newsgroup data and Freebase, we have
   extended the experiments on clustering results by using all the
   combinations of text (20 newsgroup, MCAT, CCAT, ECAT) and world
   knowledge sources (Freebase, YAGO2).}},

   removing the artifacts and redundant data from the documents by
   undergoing stop word removal process and stemming process. Then, the
   next step is the feature extraction based on Term Frequency-Inverse
   Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Wordnet features. Here, the feature is
   selected using support measure named ModSupport, and then, the
   incremental document clustering is performed based on the hybrid fuzzy
   bounding degree and Rider-Moth Flame optimization algorithm (RMFO) using
   the boundary degree. Here, the RMFO aims at the selection of the optimal
   weights for the boundary degree model and is designed by integrating
   Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) with Moth Flame optimization (MFO).
   The performance of the proposed RMFO outperformed the existing
   techniques using accuracy, F-measure, precision, and recall with maximal
   values 93.98\%, 94.876\%, 93.958\% and 93.964\% respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Internet is a wide network of unstructured data such as blogs, tweets,
   mails, files. The retrieval of correct data is necessary. Data
   clustering is the process of putting together data into groups which are
   coherently similar. Clustering minimizes search time as similar
   documents are in the same cluster. Named entity recognition method
   allocates noun entities to different sections named as person, location
   etc. Latent dirichlet allocation treats documents as mixture of topics,
   and works as generative model. We have used Reuters 21578 dataset, self
   created dataset, News article dataset, web dataset for processing. The
   proposed system consists of preprocessing web document data for removing
   unwanted data. Next is the feature extraction phase through named entity
   recognition method and topic modeling approach(LDA). Feature extraction
   shrinks data dimensionality. K-prototype clustering algorithm approach
   performs better for clustering as it takes into consideration number of
   mismatches for categorical data. The execution time and space utilized
   by K-prototype algorithm is better than Fuzzy clustering algorithm}},

   since several applications require to automatically organizing large

   scalable clustering method able to effectively organize huge amount of

   proposed method deals simultaneously with the issue of clustering huge
   amount of documents and the issue of high dimensionality of textual data
   by respectively integrating the divide and conquer approach and
   implementing a new document hashing strategy. These two facts have shown
   an important improvement of scalability and a good approximation of
   clustering quality results. Experiments performed on several large

Abstract = {{Document clustering requires a deep understanding of the complex
   structure of long-text; in particular, the intra-sentential (local) and
   inter-sentential features (global). Existing representation learning
   models do not fully capture these features. To address this, we present
   a novel graph-based representation for document clustering that builds a
   graph autoencoder (GAE) on a Keyword Correlation Graph. The graph is
   constructed with topical keywords as nodes and multiple local and global
   features as edges. A GAE is employed to aggregate the two sets of
   features by learning a latent representation which can jointly
   reconstruct them. Clustering is then performed on the learned
   representations, using vector dimensions as features for inducing
   document classes. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that the
   features learned by our approach can achieve better clustering
   performance than other existing features, including term
   frequency-inverse document frequency and average embedding.}},

Abstract = {{Recently Information Technology is used extensively for wide range of
   application for example solutions enabled through e-commerce to
   different web based information system. This usage has lead to
   development of large textual data base. Mostly this information data is
   stored in unstructured text. This large data developed has lead to the
   need of its systematic clustering for easy data retrieval organization
   and summarization, typically called as data mining. Many techniques such
   as document clustering, web based result clustering and information
   visualization are developed by the researchers based on various
   algorithms such as k-means, k-medoid, Bisecting k-means, Suffix Tree
   Clustering (STC), Hierarchical clustering, Lingo and nature inspired
   optimization algorithm like clustering using Ant colony optimization,
   Fireflies and so on. Although these techniques are widely used, these
   are suffered from inconsistencies in cluster content and inconsistencies
   in cluster description. Therefore this paper presents a novel approach
   termed as `Semantic Lingo' based on concept of the text data. This
   concept driven approach is executed on Wordnet. The developed approach
   identifies the predominant notion and automatically generate clusters
   based on these notion. The standard available dataset ODP, AMBIENT are
   used in the paper for validation of the proposed concept. The data
   clusters obtained from the proposed concept has shown high precision
   level and recall.}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Concept Factorization (CF)
   are two popular methods for finding the low-rank approximation of
   nonnegative matrix. Different from NMF, CF can be applied not only to
   the matrix containing negative values but also to the kernel space.
   Based on NMF and CF, many methods, such as Graph regularized Nonnegative
   Matrix Factorization (GNMF) and Locally Consistent Clustering
   Factorization (LCCF) can significandy improve the performance of
   clustering. Unfortunately, these are unsupervised learning methods. In
   order to enhance the clustering performance with the supervisory
   information, a Semi-Supervised Concept Factorization (SSCF) is proposed
   in this paper by incorporating the pairwise constraints into CF as the
   reward and penalty terms, which can guarantee that the data points
   belonging to a cluster in the original space are still in the same
   cluster in the transformed space. By comparing with the
   state-of-the-arts algorithms (KM, NMF, CF, LCCF, GNMF, PCCF),
   experimental results on document clustering show that the proposed
   algorithm has better performance in terms of accuracy and mutual
   information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is a gathering of textual content documents into
   groups or clusters. The main aim is to cluster the documents, which are
   internally logical but considerably different from each other. It is a
   crucial process used in information retrieval, information extraction
   and document organization. In recent years, the spectral clustering is
   widely applied in the field of machine learning as an innovative
   clustering technique. This research work proposes a novel Spectral
   Clustering algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (SCPSO) to improve
   the text document clustering. By considering global and local
   optimization function, the randomization is carried out with the initial
   population. This research work aims at combining the spectral clustering
   with swarm optimization to deal with the huge volume of text documents.
   The proposed algorithm SCPSO is examined with the benchmark database
   against the other existing approaches. The proposed algorithm SCPSO is
   compared with the Spherical K-means, Expectation Maximization Method
   (EM) and standard PSO Algorithm. The concluding results show that the
   proposed SCPSO algorithm yields better clustering accuracy than other
   clustering techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A new feature selection method to improve the document clustering using

Abstract = {{The large amount of text information on the Internet and in modern
   applications makes dealing with this volume of information complicated.
   The text clustering technique is an appropriate tool to deal with an
   enormous amount of text documents by grouping these documents into
   coherent groups. The document size decreases the effectiveness of the
   text clustering technique. Subsequently, text documents contain sparse
   and uninformative features (i.e., noisy, irrelevant, and unnecessary
   features), which affect the effectiveness of the text clustering
   technique. The feature selection technique is a primary unsupervised
   learning method employed to select the informative text features to
   create a new subset of a document's features. This method is used to
   increase the effectiveness of the underlying clustering algorithm.
   Recently, several complex optimization problems have been successfully
   solved using meta heuristic algorithms. This paper proposes a novel
   feature selection method, namely, feature selection method using the
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (FSPSOTC) to solve the
   feature selection problem by creating a new subset of informative text
   features. This new subset of features can improve the performance of the
   text clustering technique and reduce the computational time. Experiments
   were conducted using six standard text datasets with several
   characteristics. These datasets are commonly used in the domain of the
   text clustering. The results revealed that the proposed method (FSPSOTC)
   enhanced the effectiveness of the text clustering technique by dealing
   with a new subset of informative features. The proposed method is
   compared with the other well-known algorithms i.e., feature selection
   method using a genetic algorithm to improve the text clustering
   (FSGATC), and feature selection method using the harmony search
   algorithm to improve the text clustering (FSHSTC) in the text feature
   selection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Text visualization is a rapidly growing sub-field of information
   visualization and visual analytics. There are many approaches and
   techniques introduced every year to address a wide range of challenges
   and analysis tasks, enabling researchers from different disciplines to
   obtain leading-edge knowledge from digitized collections of text. This
   can be challenging particularly when the data is massive. Additionally,
   the sources of digital text have spread substantially in the last
   decades in various forms, such as web pages, blogs, twitter, email,
   electronic publications, and digitized books. In response to the
   explosion of text visualization research literature, the first text
   visualization survey article was published in 2010. Furthermore, there
   are a growing number of surveys that review existing techniques and
   classify them based on text research methodology. In this work, we aim
   to present the first Survey of Surveys (SoS) that review all of the
   surveys and state-of-the-art papers on text visualization techniques and
   provide an SoS classification. We study and compare the 14 surveys, and
   categorize them into five groups: (1) Document-centered, (2) user task
   analysis, (3) cross-disciplinary, (4) multi-faceted, and (5)
   satellite-themed. We provide survey recommendations for researchers in
   the field of text visualization. The result is a very unique, valuable
   starting point and overview of the current state-of-the-art in text
   visualization research literature.}},

   text-visual retrieval}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recently, learning-based cross-modal hashing has gained increasing
   research interests for its low computation complexity and memory
   requirement. Among existing cross-modal techniques, supervised
   algorithms can gain better performance. However, due to the cost of
   acquiring labeled data, unsupervised methods become our choice when
   faced with large scale unlabeled web images. The label-free nature of
   unsupervised cross-modal hashing hinders models from exploiting the
   exact semantic data similarity. Existing research typically simulates
   the semantics by a heuristic geometric prior in the original feature
   space with pseudo labels or traditional dense graph structures. However,
   this introduces heavy bias into the model as the original features are
   not fully representing the underlying multi-view data relations, and
   these two structures may face with issues like interference noise or
   high sensitivity to cluster number. To address the problem above, in
   this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised sparse-graph based hashing
   method called Semantic-Rebased Cross-modal Hashing (SRCH). A novel
   `Set-and-Rebase' process is defined to initialize and update the
   cross-modal similarity graph of training data. In particular, we set the
   graph according to the intra-modal feature geometric basis and then
   alternately rebase it to update the edges within according to the
   hashing results. We develop an alternating optimization routine to
   rebase the graph and train the hashing auto-encoders with closed-form
   solutions so that the overall framework is efficiently trained. Our
   experimental results on benchmarked datasets demonstrate the superiority
   of our model against state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Text visual question answering (TextVQA) targets at answering the
   question related to texts appearing in the given images, posing more
   challenges than VQA by requiring a deeper recognition and understanding
   of various shapes of human-readable scene texts as well as their
   meanings in different contexts. Existing works on TextVQA suffer from
   two weaknesses: i) scene texts and non-textual objects are processed
   separately and independently without considering their mutual
   interactions during the question understanding and answering process,
   ii) scene texts are encoded only through word embeddings without taking
   the corresponding visual appearance features as well as their potential
   relationships with other non-textual objects in the images into account.
   To overcome the weakness of existing works, we propose a novel
   multi-modal contextual graph neural network (MCG) model for TextVQA. The
   proposed MCG model can capture the relationships between visual features
   of scene texts and non-textual objects in the given images as well as
   utilize richer sources of multi-modal features to improve the model
   performance. In particular, we encode the scene texts into richer
   features containing textual, visual and positional features, then model
   the visual relations between scene texts and non-textual objects through
   a contextual graph neural network. Our extensive experiments on
   real-world dataset demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MCG model
   over baseline approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language
   processing and text data mining. It remains challenging because texts
   have complex internal structure besides the sparsity in the
   high-dimensional representation. In the paper, we propose a new Neural
   Variational model with mixture-of-Gaussians prior for Text Clustering
   (abbr. NVTC) to reveal the underlying textual manifold structure and
   cluster documents effectively. NVTC is a deep latent variable model
   built on the basis of the neural variational inference. In NVTC, the
   stochastic latent variable, which is modeled as one obeying a Gaussian
   mixture distribution, plays an important role in establishing the
   association of documents and document labels. On the other hand, by
   joint learning, NVTC simultaneously learns text encoded representations
   and cluster assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that NVTC is
   able to learn clustering-friendly representations of texts. It
   significantly outperforms several baselines including VAE+GMM, VaDE,
   LCK-NFC, GSDPMM and LDA on four benchmark text datasets in terms of ACC,
   NMI, and AMI. Furthermore, NVTC learns effective latent embeddings of
   texts which are interpretable by topics of texts, where each dimension
   of latent embeddings corresponds to a specific topic.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing amount of text information on the Internet web pages
   affects the clustering analysis. The text clustering is a favorable
   analysis technique used for partitioning a massive amount of information
   into clusters. Hence, the major problem that affects the text clustering

   documents. The feature selection (FS) is an important unsupervised
   technique used to eliminate uninformative features to encourage the text
   clustering technique. Recently, the meta-heuristic algorithms are
   successfully applied to solve several optimization problems. In this
   paper, we proposed the harmony search (HS) algorithm to solve the
   feature selection problem (FSHSTC). The proposed method is used to
   enhance the text clustering (TC) technique by obtaining a new subset of
   informative or useful features. Experiments were applied using four
   benchmark text datasets. The results show that the proposed FSHSTC is

Abstract = {{Topic modelling is a text mining technique to discover common topics in
   a collection of documents. The proposed methodology of topic modelling
   used artificial neural networks to improve the clustering mechanism of
   similar documents by modelling probabilistic relations between the
   topics, documents and vocabulary. Currently, while topic modelling and
   clustering are considered to be manifestations of unsupervised learning,
   and neural networks on the other hand are used for supervised learning
   problems, Neural Topic Modelling reformulated topic modelling into a
   supervised learning task by defining an objective function whose loss
   function had to be minimised. Custom input embedding layers were
   designed in order to extract the semantic relationships between the
   words in the corpus, and the output of the model presented a topic
   probability distribution for each document. The documents with similar
   distributions were then bucketed together based on the criteria of
   meeting the threshold value of a simple distance based similarity
   metric, such as cosine similarity. The model was implemented using Keras
   with TensorFlow backend and the effectiveness of the clustering was
   validated on the IMDB Movie dataset and the News Aggregator dataset from
   UCI. On comparison with other commonly used clustering mechanisms in
   combination with traditional topic models, the proposed model delivered
   an improved Silhouette Co-efficient Score and Davies-Bouldin Index,
   along with an increased data handling capacity, thereby making the
   solution scalable.}},

Abstract = {{As a data mining method, clustering, which is one of the most important
   tools in information retrieval, organizes data based on unsupervised
   learning which means that it does not require any training data. But,
   some text clustering algorithms cannot update existing clusters
   incrementally and, instead, have to recompute a new clustering from
   scratch. In view of above, this paper presents a novel down-top
   incremental conceptual hierarchical text clustering approach using
   CFu-tree (ICHTC-CF) representation, which starts with each item as a
   separate cluster. Term-based feature extraction is used for summarizing
   a cluster in the process. The Comparison Variation measure criterion is
   also adopted for judging whether the closest pair of clusters can be
   merged or a previous cluster can be split. And, our incremental
   clustering method is not sensitive to the input data order. Experimental
   results show that the performance of our method outperforms k-means,
   CLIQUE, single linkage clustering and complete linkage clustering, which
   indicate our new technique is efficient and feasible. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Clustering documents is an essential step in improving efficiency and
   effectiveness of information retrieval systems. We propose a two-phase
   split-merge (SM) algorithm, which can be applied to topical clusters
   obtained from existing query-context-aware document clustering
   algorithms, to produce soft topical document clusters. The SM is a
   post-processing technique which combines the advantages of document and
   feature-pivot topical document clustering approaches. The split phase
   splits the topical clusters by relating them to the topics obtained by
   disambiguating web search results, and converts them into homogeneous
   soft clusters. In the merge phase, similar clusters are merged by
   feature-pivot approach. The SM is tested on the outcome of two
   hierarchical query-context aware document clustering algorithms on
   different datasets including TREC session-track 2011 dataset. The
   obtained topical-clusters are also updated by an incremental approach
   with the progress in the data stream. The proposed algorithm improves
   the quality of clustering appreciably in all the experiments conducted.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering addresses the problem of identifying groups of
   similar documents without human supervision. Unlike most existing
   solutions that perform document clustering based on keywords matching,
   we propose an algorithm that considers the meaning of the terms in the
   documents. For example, a document that contains the words ``dog{''} and
   ``cat{''} multiple times may be placed in the same category as a
   document that contains the word ``pet{''} even if the two documents
   share only noise words in common. Our semantic clustering algorithm is
   based on a similarity graph that stores the degree of semantic
   relationship between terms (extracted from WordNet), where a term can be
   a word or a phrase. We experimentally validate our algorithm on the
   Reuters-21578 benchmark, which contains 11, 362 newswire stories that
   are grouped in 82 categories using human judgment. We apply the k-means
   clustering algorithm to group the documents using a similarity metric
   that is based on keywords matching and one that uses the similarity
   graph. We show that the second approach produces higher precision and
   recall, which means that this approach matches closer the results of the
   human study.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a new initial centroid selection for a K-means document
   clustering algorithm, namely, Dissimilarity-based Initial Centroid
   selection for DOCument clustering using K-means (DIC-DOC-K-means), to
   improve the performance of text document clustering is proposed. The
   first centroid is the document having the minimum standard deviation of
   its term frequency. Each of the other subsequent centroids is selected
   based on the dissimilarities of the previously selected centroids. For
   comparing the performance of the proposed DIC-DOC-K-means algorithm, the
   results of the K-means, K-means++ and weighted average of terms-based
   initial centroid selection + K-means (Weight\_Avg\_Initials + K-means)
   clustering algorithms are considered. The results show that the proposed
   DIC-DOC-K-means algorithm performs significantly better than the
   K-means, K-means++ and Weight\_Avg\_Initials+ K-means clustering
   algorithms for Reuters-21578 and WebKB with respect to purity, entropy
   and F-measure for most of the cluster sizes. The cluster sizes used for
   Reuters-8 are 8, 16, 24 and 32 and those for WebKB are 4, 8, 12 and 16.
   The results of the proposed DIC-DOC-K-means give a better performance

Abstract = {{A key challenge for document clustering consists in finding a proper
   similarity measure for text documents that enables the generation of
   cohesive groups. Measures based on the classic bag-of-words model take
   into account solely the presence (and frequency) of words in documents.
   In doing so, semantically similar documents which use different
   vocabularies may end up in different clusters. For this reason, semantic
   similarity measures that use external knowledge, such as word n-gram
   corpora or thesauri, have been proposed in the literature. In this
   paper, the Frequency Google Tri-gram Measure is proposed to assess
   similarity between documents based on the frequencies of terms in the
   compared documents as well as the Google n-gram corpus as an additional
   semantic similarity source. Clustering algorithms are applied to several
   real datasets in order to experimentally evaluate the quality of the
   clusters obtained with the proposed measure and compare it with a number
   of state-of-the-art measures from the literature. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed measure improves significantly the
   quality of document clustering, based on statistical tests. We further
   demonstrate that clustering results combining bag-of-words and semantic
   similarity are superior to those obtained with either approach
   independently.}},

Abstract = {{As a popular topic model, Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA)
   has been widely applied in text clustering due to its reliability and
   practicability. While independence assumption contributes to its
   practicability, it loses the rich local information between words, which
   in some cases will result in incoherent topics. In this paper, we
   propose an enhanced PLSA model embedded with word correlation (EWPLSA)
   for text clustering. The new model can utilize a wide range of pairwise
   semantic constraints between words to get more meaningful topics. We
   study how to consider context information of all the words, trained with
   the global semantic distribution in a global manner. The relationship
   between similar words will be amplified in a global perspective in the
   next iteration. However, it will also be restricted by other words
   because all word contexts are considered. In this way, instead of
   generating independently, the topic assignment of each word is affected
   by other correlative words. In addition, we initialize several important
   parameters before the first iteration of the EM algorithm according to
   the local correlation information between words, leading to the
   reduction of iteration number. Experiments on two datasets have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is a widely studied problem in the text mining domain.
   The Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model based clustering
   algorithms have shown good performance to cope with high dimensional
   sparse text data, obtaining reasonable results in both clustering
   accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the time complexity of
   DMM model training is proportional to the average document length and
   the number of clusters, making it inefficient for scaling up to long
   text and large corpora, which is common in real-world applications such
   as documents organization, retrieval and recommendation. In this paper,
   we leverage a symmetric prior setting for Dirichlet distribution, and
   build indices to decrease the time complexity of the sampling-based
   training for DMM from O(K {*} L) to O(K {*} U), where K is the number of
   clusters, L the average length of document, and U the average number of
   unique words in each document. We introduce a Metropolis-Hastings
   sampling algorithm, which further reduces the sampling time complexity
   from O(K{*}U) to O(U) in the nearly-to-convergence training stages.
   Moreover, we also parallelize the DMM model training to obtain a further
   acceleration by using an uncollapsed Gibbs sampler. We combine all these
   optimizations into a highly efficient implementation, called X-DMM,
   which enables the DMM model to scale up for long and large-scale text
   clustering. We evaluate the performance of X-DMM on several real world
   datasets, and the experimental results show that X-DMM achieves
   substantial speed up compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms
   without clustering accuracy degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The Document clustering plays significant role in Information Retrieval
   (IR) where it organizes documents prior to the retrieval process. To
   date, various clustering algorithms have been proposed and this includes
   the K-means and Particle Swarm Optimization. Even though these
   algorithms have been widely applied in many disciplines due to its
   simplicity, such an approach tends to be trapped in a local minimum
   during its search for an optimal solution. To address the shortcoming,
   this paper proposes a Basic Firefly (Basic FA) algorithm to cluster text
   documents. The algorithm employs the Average Distance to Document
   Centroid (ADDC) as the objective function of the search. Experiments
   utilizing the proposed algorithm were conducted on the 20Newsgroups
   benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate that the Basic FA generates a
   more robust and compact clusters than the ones produced by K-means and
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is one of the text mining tasks that is employed in
   search engines. Discovering the optimal number of clusters for a dataset
   or repository is a challenging problem. Various clustering algorithms
   have been reported in the literature but most of them rely on a
   pre-defined value of the k clusters. In this study, a variant of Firefly
   algorithm, termed as FireflyClust, is proposed to automatically cluster
   text documents in a hierarchical manner. The proposed clustering method
   operates based on five phases: data pre-processing, clustering, item
   re-location, cluster selection and cluster refinement. Experiments are
   undertaken based on different selections of threshold value. Results on
   the TREC collection named TR11, TR12, TR23 and TR45, showed that the
   FireflyClust is a better approach than the Bisect K-means, hybrid Bisect
   K-means and Practical General Stochastic Clustering Method. Such a
   result would enlighten the directions in developing a better information
   retrieval engine for this dynamic and fast growing big data era.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is an important topic in text mining. One of the most
   effective methods for text clustering is an approach based on frequent
   itemsets (FIs), and thus, there are many related algorithms that aim to
   improve the accuracy of text clustering. However, these do not focus on
   the weights of terms in documents, even though the frequency of each
   term in each document has a great impact on the results. In this work,
   we propose a new method for text clustering based on frequent weighted
   utility itemsets (FWUI). First, we calculate the Term Frequency (TF) for
   each term in documents to create a weight matrix for all documents. The
   weights of terms in documents are based on the Inverse Document
   Frequency. Next, we use the Modification Weighted Itemset Tidset
   (MWIT)-FWUI algorithm for mining FWUI from a number matrix and the
   weights of terms in documents. Finally, based on frequent utility
   itemsets, we cluster documents using the MC (Maximum Capturing)
   algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated on three data sets
   consisting of 1,600 documents covering 16 topics. The experimental
   results show that our method, using FWUI, improves the accuracy of the
   text clustering compared to methods using FIs.}},

Abstract = {{Living in our information society poses the challenge of having to deal
   with a plethora of information. While most content is represented
   through text, keyword extraction and visualization techniques allow the
   processing and adjustment of text presentation to the readers'
   individual requirements and preferences. In this paper, we investigate
   four types of text visualizations and their feasibility to give readers
   an overview before they actually engage with a text: word clouds,
   highlighting, mind maps, and image collages. In a user study with 50
   participants, we assessed the effects of such visualizations on reading
   comprehension, reading time, and subjective impressions. Results show
   that (1) mind maps best support readers in getting the gist of a text,
   (2) they also give better subjective impressions on text content and
   structure, and (3) highlighting keywords in a text before reading helps
   to reduce reading time. We discuss a set of guidelines to inform the
   design of automated systems for creating text visualizations for reader
   support.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is the process of partitioning a set of data objects into
   subsets. It is commonly used technique in data mining, information
   retrieval, and knowledge discovery for finding hidden patterns or
   objects from a data of different category. Text clustering process deals
   with grouping of an unstructured collection of documents into
   semantically related groups. A document is considered as a bag of words
   in traditional document clustering methods; however, semantic meaning of
   word is not considered. Thus, more informative features like concept
   weight are important to achieve accurate document clustering and this
   can be achieved through semantic document clustering because it takes
   meaningful relationship into account. This paper highlights major
   challenges in traditional document clustering and semantic document
   clustering along with brief discussion. This paper identifies five major
   areas under semantic clustering and presents a survey of 17 papers that
   has studied, covering major significant works. Moreover, this paper also
   provides a survey of tools, ontology databases, and algorithms, which
   help in applying and evaluating document clustering. The presented
   survey is used in preparing the proposed work in the same direction.
   This proposed work uses the concept weight for text clustering system
   which is to be developed based on a Hierarchical Agglomerative
   Clustering, Bisecting k-means algorithm, and Self Organized Map Neural
   Network in accordance with the principles of WordNet ontology as a
   background knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Media conversion technologies such as speech recognition and speech
   synthesis have gained a lot of attention in recent years. They are
   applied in various human communication tools through smart phones and

   learner still have loss in naturalness pronunciation problem because of
   effects on mother tongue interference. Although the learner can realize
   that his/her speech is different from the trainer's, the learner still
   cannot detect or check the precise wrong part in their utterances
   speech. We indicate these differences by visualizing a learner's wrong
   and correct pronunciation with speech-to-animated text visualization
   tool. In this study, we focused on the media conversion process between
   speech prosodic information and animated text information by using AHP
   method as the mapping method. The pairwise comparison between both
   speech and text information were conducted and evaluated by Japanese

Abstract = {{Clustering is a key problem in several applications. Although this task
   is originally unsupervised, there are many proposals leveraging
   different supervision signals in order to improve clustering
   performance. Some semi-supervised clustering methods employ pairwise
   constraints to inform the learning algorithm about pairs of instances
   that should be in the same cluster (must-link constraints or similar
   instances) and pairs that should be in different clusters (cannot-link
   constraints or dissimilar instances). In many applications, to provide
   pairwise constraints is cheaper than asking users for explicit labels on
   the data. More recently, deep clustering methods have been proposed in
   the literature. Such methods consists in learning a deep neural
   representation of the input data in order to improve clustering. In this
   paper, we present TextCSN, a deep clustering approach that combines (i)
   a Convolutional Siamese Network (CSN) based on pairwise constraints to
   perform representation learning and (ii) the traditional K-Means
   algorithm for unsupervised clustering using the learned representation.
   As far as we know, this is the first semi-supervised deep learning
   method based on pairwise constraints applied on text clustering. By
   means of eight text clustering tasks, we assess our approach comparing
   it with two baselines: MPC-KMeans, a semi-supervised clustering
   algorithm; and ordinary K-Means algorithm. Results indicate that the
   proposed approach outperforms the baselines in six of these datasets,
   and its performance increases with the number of constraints provided.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-lingual document clustering is the task of automatically
   organizing a large collection of multi-lingual documents into a few
   clusters, depending on their content or topic. It is well known that
   language barrier and translation ambiguity are two challenging issues
   for cross-lingual document representation. To this end, we propose to
   represent cross-lingual documents through statistical word senses, which
   are automatically discovered from a parallel corpus through a novel
   cross-lingual word sense induction model and a sense clustering method.
   In particular, the former consists in a sense-based vector space model
   and the latter leverages on a sense-based latent Dirichlet allocation.
   Evaluation on the benchmarking datasets shows that the proposed models
   outperform two state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual document
   clustering.}},

   need for developing dedicated computational tools for information

Abstract = {{Document clustering, which is used for topic discovery and similarity
   computation, has received a great deal of attention in text data
   management. Methods that have been adopted in traditional clustering,
   particularly for multi-topic documents, are not viable because the
   contents that are distinguished by the sub topical structure may not be
   pertinent across the entire documents. In this paper, a sub-document
   based framework for clustering multiple documents is proposed in which
   LDA is used for document segmentation. The proposed improvised framework
   is a two-way approach to address the clustering problem. First, instead
   of applying a clustering algorithm to the entire data sets, documents
   are partitioned into cohesive sub-documents along topic boundaries
   through text segmentation to establish a two-level representation of
   text data, i.e., topics and words. Second, the proposed framework is
   compared to existing clustering methods, both traditional and segment
   based clustering through different clustering algorithms using the
   F-measure as the measurement metric. In addition, various real-time data
   sets that contain multi-topic documents are applied to validating the
   clustering algorithms through the proposed sub-document based framework.
   Each sub-document is clustered within a document and the resulting
   clusters are further clustered across the documents. Experimental
   results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering
   approaches in terms of the F-measure as well as efficiency at least 73\%
   with LDA segmentation and bisecting LDA in comparison to TextTiling.}},

   modified to reduce its dimensionality. Then, Bisecting K-means algorithm
   is executed over the modified document set to obtain a set of very
   meaningful clusters. It has been shown that the proposed approach,
   Clustering preceded by Graph Mining based Maximal Frequent Termsets
   Preservation (CGFTP), produces better quality clusters than produced by
   some classical document clustering algorithm(s). It has also been shown
   that the produced clusters are easily interpretable. The quality of

Abstract = {{Document clustering, one of the traditional data mining techniques, is
   an unsupervised learning paradigm where clustering methods try to
   identify inherent groupings of the text documents, so that a set of
   clusters is produced in which clusters exhibit high intra-cluster
   similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. The importance of document
   clustering emerges from the massive volumes of textual documents
   created. For distributed document clustering, we experimented on Hadoop
   and MapReduce open source platforms. We tested on two datasets
   consisting of 20000 (20-NewsGroup) and 21578 (Reuters) documents. We
   focused on efficient pre-processing wherein we applied syntactic and
   semantics tagging to the dataset. Here, we have suggested syntactic and
   semantic parsing i.e. POS tagging, and word sense disambiguation for
   better understanding of synonymous words and hyponymy words using
   WordNet. Porter's Stemming algorithm is revised and compared with
   traditional algorithm. We also suggest different order of preprocessing
   steps. We performed experiments to generate various clusters with
   different count of iterations for refining the clusters. Also, for
   monitoring the scale-up of Hadoop we added nodes and compared the time
   taken for clustering.}},

Abstract = {{The web today is a growing universe of vast amounts of documents.
   Clustering techniques help to enhance information retrieval and
   processing huge volume of data, as it groups similar documents into one
   group. The relevant feature identification from a high-dimensional data
   is one of the challenges in text document clustering. We propose a
   sentence ranking approach which finds out the relevant terms in the
   documents so as to improve the feature identification and selection.
   Preserving the correlation between terms in the document, the document
   vectors are mapped into a lower dimensional concept space. We used
   k-rank approximation method which minimizes the error between the
   original term-document matrix and its map in the concept space. The
   similarity matrix is converted into a fuzzy equivalence relation by
   calculating the max-min transitive closure. On this, we applied fuzzy
   rules to efficiently cluster the documents. Our proposed method has
   shown good accuracy than previously known techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In the unsuprevised learning method of text mining process that is in
   prevalence, the issues pertaining to multi dimensionality is turning out
   to be a major factor, as the clustering is not focusing on optimal
   evaluation of concept, context and semantic relevancy, which are also
   very essential in terms of clustering process. In majority of the models
   that are proposed earlier, the factors like the term frequency, were
   considered and the clustering has been focusing only on one factor of
   Semantic, whereas as context and conceptual factors also play a
   significant importance. In extension to the earlier model of MODC, and
   DC3SR, the proposed model of Multi-objective Distance based Optimal
   Document Clustering (MODC) by GA has been proposed in the study. Among
   the lessons that are learnt from the review of earlier models., the
   scope for fuzzy guided multi-objective optimal document clustering
   (FMODC) approach which shall support in more effective computation and
   clustering using the Genetic Algorithm is discussed in the case
   scenario. From the experimentation process that is focused in the study,
   using the meta-text data gathered from the same publisher, the model has
   been tested in comparative analysis to other two models, BADC and AC-DCO
   and the outcome in terms of optimum clustering that has been achieved
   with FMODC model depicts the kind of accuracy in the model and the
   system. An unsupervised learning approach to form the initial clusters
   that estimates similarity between any two documents by concept, context
   and semantic relevance score and further optimizes by fuzzy genetic
   algorithm is proposed. This novel method represents the concept as
   correlation between arguments and activities in given documents, context
   as correlation between meta-text of the documents and the semantic
   relevance is assessed by estimating the similarity between documents
   through the hyponyms of the arguments. The meta-text of the documents
   considered for context assessment contains the authors list, keywords
   list and list of document versioning time schedules. The experiments
   were conducted to assess the significance of the proposed model.}},

Title = {{Boosting Discrimination Information Based Document Clustering Using
   Consensus and Classification}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{78954-78962}},
Abstract = {{Adequate choice of term discrimination information measure (DIM)
   stipulates guaranteed document clustering. Exercise for the right choice
   is empirical in nature, and characteristics of data in the documents
   help experts to speculate a viable solution. Thus, a consistent DIM for
   the clustering is a mere conjecture and demands intelligent selection of
   the information measure. In this work, we propose an automated consensus
   building measure based on a text classifier. Two distinct DIMs construct
   basic partitions of documents and form base clusters. The consensus
   building measure method uses the clusters information to find concordant
   documents and constitute a dataset to train the text classifier. The
   classifier predicts labels for discordant documents from earlier
   clustering stage and forms new clusters. The experimentation is
   performed with eight standard data sets to test efficacy of the proposed
   technique. The improvement observed by applying the proposed consensus
   clustering demonstrates its superiority over individual results.
   Relative Risk (RR) and Measurement of Discrimination Information (MDI)
   are the two discrimination information measures used for obtaining the
   base clustering solutions in our experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is an effective approach to collect and organize text
   documents into meaningful groups for mining valuable information on the
   Internet. However, there exist some issues to tackle such as feature
   extraction and data dimension reduction. To overcome these problems, we
   present a novel approach named deep-learning vocabulary network. The
   vocabulary network is constructed based on related-word set, which
   contains the `` cooccurrence{''} relations of words or terms. We replace
   term frequency in feature vectors with the `` importance{''} of words in
   terms of vocabulary network and PageRank, which can generate more
   precise feature vectors to represent the meaning of text clustering.
   Furthermore, sparse-group deep belief network is proposed to reduce the
   dimensionality of feature vectors, and we introduce coverage rate for
   similarity measure in Single-Pass clustering. To verify the
   effectiveness of our work, we compare the approach to the representative
   algorithms, and experimental results show that feature vectors in terms
   of deep-learning vocabulary network have better clustering performance.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic algorithm has strong capabilities in global optimization but
   it has a high likelihood of falling into local optimums. In contrast,
   the simulated annealing algorithm has strong capabilities in local

   this paper proposes a hybrid simulated-genetic algorithm (HSGA) to
   perform text clustering. We use HSGA specifically to optimize the
   initialization of the cluster centers for every iteration in the K-means
   clustering algorithm that is used to cluster text data. In addition, we
   also utilize the adaptive genetic algorithm to extract the eigenvalues
   of the text data, which performs dimensionality reduction and further
   improve the performance of the clustering. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the Hybrid simulated-genetic algorithm for text
   clustering not only improves the accuracy and recall rate of the text

Abstract = {{The text clustering is one of core issues in the field of text mining
   and information retrieval. The clustering algorithm is divided into four
   categories: the partitioned clustering algorithm, the hierarchical
   clustering algorithm, density-based clustering algorithm, as well as
   intelligence clustering algorithm, but at present, many of which cannot
   meet the demand of speed and self-adapting about text clustering.
   Therefore this paper proposed a text clustering algorithm based on find
   of density peaks. The algorithm was implemented by the calculation of
   text distance and density, which was in accordance with calculation of
   the text vector similarity. SVM was used to express text to obtain the
   vector mapping for the similarity calculation. The next work was the
   finding of the local density and the distance from points of higher
   density of each text, removing the noise points, selecting the cluster
   center. The remaining points were assigned into the cluster which its
   nearest cluster center represented. According to several sets of
   contrast experiment, the density-based text clustering has an advantage
   of reliability and robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Text documents clustering is a popular unsupervised text mining tool. It
   is used for partitioning a collection of text documents into similar
   clusters based on the distance or similarity measure as decided by an
   objective function. Text clustering algorithm often makes prior
   assumptions to satisfy objective function, which is optimized either
   through traditional techniques or meta-heuristic techniques. In text
   clustering techniques, the right decision for any document distribution
   is done using an objective function. Normally, clustering algorithms
   perform poorly when the configuration of the well-formulated objective
   function is not sound and complete. Therefore, we proposed
   multi-objectives-based method namely, combine distance and similarity
   measure for improving the text clustering technique. Multi-objectives
   text clustering method is combined with two evaluating criteria which
   emerge as a robust alternative in several situations. In particular, the
   multi-objective function in the text clustering domain is not a popular,
   and it is a core issue that affects the performance of the text
   clustering technique. The performance of multi-objectives function is
   investigated using the k-mean text clustering technique. The experiments
   were conducted using seven standard text datasets. The results showed
   that the proposed multi-objectives based method outperforms the other
   measures in term of the performance of the text clustering, evaluated by
   using two common clustering measures, namely, Accuracy and F-measure.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Twitter depicts a rich source of on-line reviews, ratings,
   recommendations, and other forms of opinion expressions. This scenario
   has created the compelling demand to develop innovative mechanisms to
   store, search, organize and analyze all this data automatically.
   Unfortunately, it is seldom available to have enough labeled data in
   Twitter, because of the cost of the process or due to the impossibility
   to obtain them, given the rapid growing and change of this kind of
   media. To avoid such limitations, unsupervised categorization strategies
   are employed. In this paper we face the problem of cross-domain short
   text clustering through a compact representation that allows us to avoid
   the problems that arise with the high dimensionality and sparseness of
   vocabulary. Our experiments, conducted on a cross-domain scenario using
   very short texts, indicate that the proposed representation allows to
   generate high quality groups, according to the value of Silhouette
   coefficient obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Gathering the most relevant data for one's need, from the huge
   collection of data in the internet is a work of great difficult. To make
   it easier, we propose an application called text clustering, which is an
   automatic grouping of text documents into clusters, so that documents
   within a cluster defines the similarity between them, but they are not
   similar to documents in other clusters. Most of existing text clustering
   algorithms uses the traditional vector space model, which treats
   documents as group of words while the word sequences in the documents
   are ignored and the meaning of natural languages strongly depends on
   them. Our first objective is to implement a clustering algorithm in
   java, named Clustering based on Frequent Word Sequences. The frequent
   word sequences can provide compact and valuable information about the
   text documents. Our second objective is to use an association rule
   miner{[}13] to find the frequent two-word sets that satisfy the minimum
   support using Apriori Algorithm{[}2,5]. Our results will show that the
   finally compact documents will be more accurate and precise than the
   regular method documents.}},

Abstract = {{Machine Learning plays very important role in processing of large
   amounts of structured and unstructured data. A set of algorithms can be
   used to get meaningful insights into the data that are helpful in making
   effective business decisions. Document clustering is one of the popular
   machine learning technique used to group unstructured data (text
   documents) based on its content and further analyze the data to
   understand the patterns in it. The unstructured data gets transformed
   into semi-structured data and structured data in stages by using text
   mining and clustering (k-means) techniques. Classification is another
   machine learning technique that can be implemented for use cases like
   ``fraud detection and cross-sell \& up-sell opportunity
   identification{''} in banking, financial services and insurance
   industry. This paper focuses on the implementation of both document
   clustering algorithm and a set of classification algorithms (Decision
   Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes), along with appropriate industry
   use cases. Also, the performance of three classification algorithms will
   be compared by calculation of ``Confusion Matrix{''} which in turn helps
   us to calculate performance measures such as, ``accuracy{''},
   ``precision{''}, and ``recall{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Topic modeling methods like LSI, pLSI, and LDA have been widely studied
   in text mining domain for various applications like document
   representation, document clustering/classification, information
   retrieval, etc. However, such unsupervised methods are effective over
   corpus with well separable topics. In real-world applications, topics
   might be of highly overlapping in nature. For example, a news corpus of
   different terror attacks has highly overlapping keywords across
   reporting of different terror events. In this paper, we propose a
   variant of LDA, named as Prioritized Named Entity driven LDA (PNE-LDA),
   which can address the issue of overlapping topics by prioritizing named
   entities related to the topics. From various experimental setups, it is
   observed that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts in entity
   driven overlapping topics.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional semi-supervised clustering uses only limited user
   supervision in the form of instance seeds for clusters and pairwise
   instance constraints to aid unsupervised clustering. However, user
   supervision can also be provided in alternative forms for document
   clustering, such as labeling a feature by indicating whether it
   discriminates among clusters. This article thus fills this void by
   enhancing traditional semi-supervised clustering with feature
   supervision, which asks the user to label discriminating features during
   defining (labeling) the instance seeds or pairwise instance constraints.
   Various types of semi-supervised clustering algorithms were explored
   with feature supervision. Our experimental results on several real-world
   data sets demonstrate that augmenting the instance-level supervision
   with feature-level supervision can significantly improve document
   clustering performance.}},

   initial cluster centers We use the ratio of the distance between the
   distance and class within the class as a criterion evaluation function,
   the number of clusters to obtain the minimum value of the criterion
   function as the best number of clusters. These improvements effectively
   overcome the shortcomings of K-means algorithm. Finally, a few examples

Title = {{Discovering Topic Representative Terms for Short Text Clustering}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{92037-92047}},
Abstract = {{Clustering short texts are one of the most important text analysis
   methods to help extract knowledge from online social media platforms,
   such as Twitter, Facebook, and Weibo. However, the instant features
   (such as abbreviation and informal expression) and the limited length of
   short texts challenge the clustering task. Fortunately, short texts
   about the same topic often share some common terms (or term stems),
   which can effectively represent a topic (i.e., supported by a cluster of
   short texts), and we also call them topic representative terms. Taking
   advantage of topic representative terms, it is much easier to cluster
   short texts by grouping short texts into the most similar topic
   representative term groups. This paper provides a novel topic
   representative term discovery (TRTD) method for short text clustering.
   In our TRTD method, we discover groups of closely bound up topic
   representative terms by exploiting the closeness and significance of
   terms. The closeness of the topic representative terms is measured by
   their interdependent co-occurrence, and the significance is measured by
   their global term occurrences throughout the whole short text corpus.
   The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRTD
   achieves better accuracy and efficiency in short text clustering than
   the state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{A text clustering algorithm is proposed to overcome the drawback of
   division based clustering method on sensitivity of estimated class
   number. Complex features including synonym and co-occurring words are
   extracted to make a feature space containing more semantic information.
   Then the divide and merge strategy helps the iteration converge to a
   reasonable cluster number. Experimental results showed that the
   dynamically updated center number prevent the deterioration of
   clustering result when k deviates from the real class numbers. When k is
   too small or large, the difference of clustering results between FC-DM
   and k-means is more obvious and FC-DM also outperformed other benchmark
   algorithms. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   untagged medical text corpus approach is presented. To achieve this, to
   create a list of documents containing each word is necessary. Then, for
   relevant term extraction, the frequency of each term is obtained in
   order to compute the word weight into the corpus and into each document.
   Finally, the clusters are built by mapping using main concepts from an
   ontology and the relevant terms (only subjects), assuming that if two
   words appear in the same documents these words are related. The obtained
   clusters have a category corresponding to ontology concepts, and they
   are measured with cluster from K-Means (assuming the k-Means cluster
   were well formed) using the Overlap Coefficient and obtaining 70\% of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a pipeline architecture for Bengali Document
   clustering and apply it for clustering Bengali news documents using
   different clustering algorithms. Our goal is to cluster news from
   different online newspapers according to the topic describing the
   identical stories. We used Word Movers Distance (WMD), a relatively new
   algorithm to measure document distances, which is based on vector
   representation of words. Later, we conduct Bengali document clustering
   using several other algorithms, namely K-means, Hierarchical Clustering
   Algorithm (HCA) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
   Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). We also evaluate the clusters against
   a manually prepared set of clusters, which we consider as the ground
   truth. Our experiment shows that, HCA performs best with a F1-score of
   92\%, which is the most similar to the number of clusters and cluster
   members compared to the ground truth. We also released a live working
   demo where the program collects the recent news from popular online
   Bengali newspapers and create clusters according to the news story.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential growth of electronic form of textual documents in both
   public and proprietary storage force researchers to find way to
   efficiently extract meaningful, actionable information from these
   documents. Document clustering has find its niche in this area. This
   paper proposes a document representational model based on distributional
   semantics, the law of distributional semantics says that the linguist
   terms that appear with similar distribution in a language corpus
   generally have similar meaning. This representation of document model
   uses only those terms (linguistic feature) that have same distribution
   over a given collection of documents. So to find this, it is needed to
   find out the distributional terms by using distributional criteria and
   then representing the documents by only these distributional terms. A
   novel similarity measure is proposed over these documents that also
   utilized the very nature of distributional semantics in similarity
   calculation. Finally, hierarchal agglomerative clustering (HAC) is used
   to produce the final clusters. Standard text mining datasets are used to
   measure the effectiveness of this approach. The evaluation is based on
   purity of clusters and proposed approach achieved far better clustering
   results in comparison to conventional approach.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{316}},
Pages = {{87-106}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Ideally, document clustering methods should produce clusters that are
   semantically relevant and readily understandable as collections of
   documents belonging to particular contexts or topics. However, existing
   popular document clustering methods often ignore term-document
   corpus-based semantics while relying upon generic measures of
   similarity. In this paper, we present CDIM, an algorithmic framework for
   partitional clustering of documents that maximizes the sum of the
   discrimination information provided by documents. CDIM exploits the
   semantic that term discrimination information provides better
   understanding of contextual topics than term-to-term relatedness to
   yield clusters that are describable by their highly discriminating
   terms. We evaluate the proposed clustering algorithm using well-known
   discrimination/semantic measures including Relative Risk (RR),
   Measurement of Discrimination Information (MDI), Domain Relevance (DR),
   and Domain Consensus (DC) on twelve data sets to prove that CDIM
   produces high-quality clusters comparable to the best methods. We also
   illustrate the understandability and efficiency of CDIM, suggesting its
   suitability for practical document clustering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Text clustering is an important method for effectively organising,
   summarising, and navigating text information. However, in the absence of
   labels, the text data to be clustered cannot be used to train the text
   representation model based on deep learning. To address the problem, an
   algorithm of text clustering based on deep representation learning is
   proposed using the transfer learning domain adaptation and the
   parameters update during cluster iteration. First, source domain data is
   used to perform the pre-training of the deep learning classification
   model. This procedure acts as an initialisation of the model parameters.
   Then, the domain discriminator is added to the model, to domain-divide
   the input sample. If the discriminator cannot distinguish which domain
   the data belongs to, the common feature space of two domains is
   obtained, so the domain adaptation problem is solved. Finally, the text
   feature vectors obtained by the model are clustered with MCSKM++
   algorithm. The algorithm not only resolves the model pre-training
   problem in unsupervised clustering, but also has a good clustering
   effect on the transfer problem caused by different numbers of domain
   labels. Experiments suggest that the clustering accuracy of the
   algorithm is superior to other similar algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{To alleviate sparseness in short text clustering, considerable
   researches investigate external information such as Wikipedia to enrich
   feature representation, which requires extra works and resources and
   might lead to possible inconsistency. Sparseness leads to weak
   connections between short texts, thus the similarity information is
   difficult to be measured. We introduce a special term-specific document
   set-potential locality set-to capture weak similarity. Specifically, for
   any two short documents within the same potential locality, the Jaccard
   similarity between them is greater than 0. In other words, the adjacency
   graph based on these weak connections is a complete graph. Further, a
   locality-sensitive term weighting scheme is proposed based on our
   potential locality set. Experimental results show the proposed approach
   builds more reliable neighborhood for short text data. Compared with
   another state-of-the-art algorithm, the proposed approach obtains better
   clustering performances, which verifies its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{K\_means algorithm is one of the typical clustering algorithms in text
   mining tasks. K\_means algorithm is widely used in many areas because of
   its easy to implement and ability to handle large datasets with better
   scalability. However, the random selection of initial cluster centroid
   in traditional K\_means algorithm for text clustering easily leads to
   local optimization and instability of clustering results. Therefore, in
   order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper propose an improved
   K\_means algorithm for document clustering which based on following two
   points: (i) we used concept distance to optimize the choice of the
   initial cluster centroid, which can avoid the drawbacks caused by random
   selection; (ii) we adopted knowledge graphs to improve traditional
   k\_means text clustering algorithm by optimizing the calculation of text
   similarity. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the
   improved algorithm could optimize the accuracy of text clustering
   effectively.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing amount of information, researchers in digital
   communities have witnessed the tremendous growth of publications. The
   overwhelming amount of information still makes it a time-consuming task.
   There are many of computer science and medical subject related documents
   cited on the Internet. Ontologies currently are hot topics in the area
   of Semantic Web. Ontologies can also help in addressing the problem of
   searching related entities, including research publications. The purpose
   of the system is to cluster the text documents based upon the ontology.
   The system is applying the modified concept weighting and become the
   extended version of the work that has been done before {[}8]. After the
   time passed the testing amount of data becomes lager and the challenges
   is the time complexity. To overcome this issue the system used the
   scoring method at the concept weighting stages to manage the time
   complexity. The experiments reveal that even the testing documents
   increased; the system may actually be able to produce useful result for

   Clustering}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{24734-24745}},
Abstract = {{Document clustering is of high importance for many natural language
   technologies. A wide range of computational traditional topic models,
   such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and its variants, have made
   great progress. However, traditional LDA-based clustering algorithms
   might not give good results due to such probabilistic models require
   prior distributions which are always difficult to define. In this paper,
   we propose a probabilistic model named tpLDA, which incorporates
   different levels of topic popularity information to determine the prior
   LDA distribution, discover the latent topics and achieve better
   clustering. Specifically, global topic popularity is introduced to
   reduce the potential distraction in local cluster popularity and the
   local cluster popularity draws more attention on certain parts of the
   global topic popularity. The two popularities contribute complementary
   information and their integration can dynamically adjust statistical
   parameters of the model. Experimental evaluations on real data sets show
   that, compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed framework
   dramatically improves the accuracy of documents clustering.}},

Abstract = {{Twitter is becoming one of the most important social sensors for

   information available on Twitter is effective in influencing opinions.
   In this study, we attempted to classify companies using tweets that
   included hash tags that corresponded to each company from language
   resources related to the companies accumulated on Twitter. However,
   there are differences in the number of tweets by companies, which may
   affect the performance of clustering. Therefore, by comparing TF-IDF
   which is a conventional method and BM25 considered in document length,
   it is confirmed whether difference in performance of companies
   clustering occurs. The collected tweets were weighted by information
   retrieval scale, and clustering result was evaluated by entropy. As a
   result, the peripheral method of BM 25 was shown to be effective in
   document clustering.}},

Abstract = {{Before seeing a patient, physicians seek to obtain an overview of the
   patient's medical history. Text plays a major role in this activity
   since it represents the bulk of the clinical documentation, but
   reviewing it quickly becomes onerous when patient charts grow too large.
   Text visualization methods have been widely explored to manage this
   large scale through visual summaries that rely on information retrieval
   algorithms to structure text and make it amenable to visualization.
   However, the integration with such automated approaches comes with a
   number of limitations, including significant error rates and the need
   for healthcare providers to fine-tune algorithms without expert
   knowledge of their inner mechanics. In addition, several of these
   approaches obscure or substitute the original clinical text and
   therefore fail to leverage qualitative and rhetorical flavours of the
   clinical notes. These drawbacks have limited the adoption of text
   visualization and other summarization technologies in clinical practice.
   In this work we present Doccurate, a novel system embodying a
   curation-based approach for the visualization of large clinical text
   datasets. Our approach offers automation auditing and customizability to
   physicians while also preserving and extensively linking to the original
   text. We discuss findings of a formal qualitative evaluation conducted
   with 6 domain experts, shedding light onto physicians' information
   needs, perceived strengths and limitations of automated tools, and the
   importance of customization while balancing efficiency. We also present
   use case scenarios to showcase Doccurate's envisioned usage in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Text visualization has become a growing and increasingly important
   subfield of information visualization. Thus, it is getting harder for
   researchers to look for related work with specific tasks or visual
   metaphors in mind. In this paper, we present an interactive visual
   survey of text visualization techniques that can be used for the
   purposes of search for related work, introduction to the subfield and
   gaining insight into research trends. We describe the taxonomy used for
   categorization of text visualization techniques and compare it to
   approaches employed in several other surveys. Finally, we present
   results of analyses performed on the entries data.}},

Title = {{A set theory based similarity measure for text clustering and
   classification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIG DATA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Similarity measures have long been utilized in information retrieval and
   machine learning domains for multi-purposes including text retrieval,
   text clustering, text summarization, plagiarism detection, and several
   other text-processing applications. However, the problem with these
   measures is that, until recently, there has never been one single
   measure recorded to be highly effective and efficient at the same time.
   Thus, the quest for an efficient and effective similarity measure is
   still an open-ended challenge. This study, in consequence, introduces a
   new highly-effective and time-efficient similarity measure for text
   clustering and classification. Furthermore, the study aims to provide a
   comprehensive scrutinization for seven of the most widely used
   similarity measures, mainly concerning their effectiveness and
   efficiency. Using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) for
   classification, the K-means algorithm for clustering, and the bag of
   word (BoW) model for feature selection, all similarity measures are
   carefully examined in detail. The experimental evaluation has been made
   on two of the most popular datasets, namely, Reuters-21 and Web-KB. The
   obtained results confirm that the proposed set theory-based similarity
   measure (STB-SM), as a pre-eminent measure, outweighs all state-of-art
   measures significantly with regards to both effectiveness and
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection is a significant task in data mining and machine
   learning applications which eliminates irrelevant and redundant features
   and improves learning performance. This paper proposes a new feature
   selection method for unsupervised text clustering named link based
   particle swarm optimization (LBPSO). This method introduces a new
   neighbour selection strategy in BPSO to select prominent features. The
   performance of traditional particle swarm optimization(PSO)is limited by
   using global best updating mechanism for feature selection. Instead of
   using global best, LBPSO particles are updated based on neighbour best
   position to enhance the exploitation and exploration capability. These
   prominent features are then tested using k-means clustering algorithm to
   improve the performance and reduce the cost of computational time of the
   proposed algorithm. The performance of LBPSO are investigated on three
   published datasets, namely Reuter 21578, TDT2 and Tr11. Our results
   based on evaluation measures show that the performance of LBPSO is
   superior than other PSO based algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This article presents silhouette-attraction (Sil-Att), a simple and

   concepts: the silhouette coefficient and the idea of attraction. The
   combination of both principles allows us to obtain a general technique

   other clustering algorithms, or as an independent clustering algorithm.
   The experimental work shows that Sil-Att is able to obtain high-quality
   results on text corpora with very different characteristics.
   Furthermore, its stable performance on all the considered corpora is
   indicative that it is a very robust method. This is a very interesting
   positive aspect of Sil-Att with respect to the other algorithms used in
   the experiments, whose performances heavily depend on specific

Abstract = {{In the bases of increasing the volume of text information, the dealing
   with text information has become incredibly complicated. The text
   clustering is a suitable technique used in dealing with a tremendous
   amount of text documents by classifying these set of text documents into
   clusters. Ultimately, text documents hold sparse, non-uniform
   distribution and uninformative features are difficult to cluster. The
   text feature selection is a primary unsupervised learning method that is
   utilized to choose a new subset of informational text features. In this
   paper, a new algorithm is proposed based on beta-hill climbing technique
   for text feature selection problem to improve the text clustering
   (B-FSTC). The results of the proposed method for beta-hill climbing and
   original Hill climbing (i.e., H-FSTC) are examined using the k-mean text
   clustering and compared with each other. Experiments were conducted on
   four standard text datasets with varying characteristics. Interestingly,
   the proposed beta-hill climbing algorithm obtains superior results in
   comparison with the other well-regard techniques by producing a new
   subset of informational text features. Lastly, the beta-hill
   climbing-based feature selection method supports the k-mean clustering
   algorithm to achieve more precise clusters.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, neural networks (NN) have achieved remarkable
   performance improvement in text classification due to their powerful
   ability to encode discriminative features by incorporating label
   information into model training. Inspired by the success of NN in text
   classification, we propose a pseudo-supervised neural network approach
   for text clustering. The neural network is trained in a supervised
   fashion with pseudo-labels, which are provided by the cluster labels of
   pre-clustering on unsupervised document representations. To enhance the

Abstract = {{One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in
   applications is the need to supervise them, a costly process that often
   requires hiring domain experts. We consider the framework to use the
   world knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is
   general-purpose knowledge, which is not designed for any specific
   domain. Then the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to
   domains and how to represent it for learning. In this paper, we provide
   an example of using world knowledge for domain dependent document
   clustering. We provide three ways to specify the world knowledge to
   domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types, and
   represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information
   network. Then we propose a clustering algorithm that can cluster
   multiple types and incorporate the sub-type information as constraints.
   In the experiments, we use two existing knowledge bases as our sources
   of world knowledge. One is Freebase, which is collaboratively collected
   knowledge about entities and their organizations. The other is YAGO2, a
   knowledge base automatically extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge
   to the linguistic knowledge base, Word Net. Experimental results on two
   text benchmark datasets (20news-groups and RCV1) show that incorporating
   world knowledge as indirect supervision can significantly outperform the
   state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms
   enhanced with world knowledge features.}},

Abstract = {{Text visualization is concerned with the representation of text in a
   graphical form to facilitate comprehension of large textual data. Its
   aim is to improve the ability to understand and utilize the wealth of
   text-based information available. An essential task in any scientific
   research is the study and review of previous works in the specified
   domain, a process that is referred to as the literature survey process.
   This process involves the identification of prior work and evaluating
   its relevance to the research question. With the enormous number of
   published studies available online in digital form, this becomes a
   cumbersome task for the researcher. This paper presents the design and
   implementation of a tool that aims to facilitate this process by
   identifying relevant work and suggesting clusters of articles by
   conceptual modeling, thus providing different options that enable the
   researcher to visualize a large number of articles in a graphical
   easy-to-analyze form. The tool helps the researcher in analyzing and
   synthesizing the literature and building a conceptual understanding of
   the designated research area. The evaluation of the tool shows that
   researchers have found it useful and that it supported the process of
   relevant work analysis given a specific research question, and 70\% of
   the evaluators of the tool found it very useful.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering techniques include automatic document organization,
   topic extraction, fast information retrieval or filtering, etc. Numerous
   methods have been developed for document clustering research. Despite
   the advances achieved, however, document clustering still presents
   certain challenges such as optimizing feature selection for
   low-dimensional docurnent representation and incorporating mutual
   information between the documents into a clustering algorithm. This
   paper mainly focuses on these two questions. First, we construct a
   domain-specific ontology that provides the controlled vocabulary
   describing the hazards related to dairy products. Synonyms of the
   controlled vocabulary in document set are considered to be relatively
   prevalent and fundamentally important for feature selection. Second, in
   combination with the vector space model (VSM), we perform singular value
   decomposition (SVD) to translate all of the term-document vectors into a
   concept space. We then obtain the mutual information between documents
   by calculating the similarity of every two document vectors in the
   orthogonal matrix of right singular vectors. As the mutual information
   matrix is also a fuzzy compatible relation, a fuzzy equivalence can be
   derived by calculating max-min transitive closure. Finally, based on the
   fuzzy equivalence relation, all of the data sequences are easily
   allocated into clusters under the guidance of a cluster validation
   index. Our method both reduces the dimensionality of the original data
   and considers the correlation between the terms. The experimental
   results show that encoding the ontologies in the aggregation process
   could provide better clustering results. Moreover, the proposed work has
   been applied to food safety supervision which is beneficial for
   government and society. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is important for a variety of information needs and
   applications such as collection management, summary and analysis.
   Especially, mining biomedical texts for knowledge discovery and
   hypothesis generation has become a very active field due to the immense
   availability of large biomedical textual database. However, most of the
   previous techniques on clustering biomedical documents have not used the
   rich information in the MeSH and Thesaurus. Furthermore, they only
   considered the keywords for document clustering without taking into
   consideration of concepts. In the proposed work, we develop a clustering
   algorithm using the semantic similarity measure that makes use of
   MeSH/WordNet ontology and the concept extracted. Initially, the
   biomedical documents are extracted from the Pub Med and the
   preprocessing techniques such as, stop word removal and stemming will be
   performed. Then, the concept is extracted using the mutual information
   defined in the information retrieval system and for every concept; the
   parent and child neighbors are identified from the MeSH/WordNet
   ontology. Then, the document clustering algorithm is devised using the
   semantic similarity measure that makes use of the weights of concept and
   its parent and child neighbors from MeSH/WordNet. Finally, the
   experimentation is carried out using the PubMed documents and the
   performance of the proposed technique is compared against the term-based
   technique using evaluation metrics. The accuracy obtained is 48.5 for
   Word Net ontology and 49.5 for MeSH ontology.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the world, people can post information about their local area
   in their own languages using social networking services. Multilingual
   short text clustering is an important task to organize such information,
   and it can be applied to various applications, such as event detection
   and summarization. However, measuring the relatedness between short
   texts written in various languages is a challenging problem. In addition
   to handling multiple languages, the semantic gaps among all languages
   must be considered. In this article, we propose two Wikipedia-based
   semantic relatedness measurement methods for multilingual short text
   clustering. The proposed methods solve the semantic gap problem by
   incorporating the inter-language links of Wikipedia into Extended Naive
   Bayes (ENB), a probabilistic method that can be applied to measure
   semantic relatedness among monolingual short texts. The proposed methods
   represent a multilingual short text as a vector of the English version
   of Wikipedia articles (entities). By transferring texts to a unified
   vector space, the relatedness between texts in different languages with
   similar meanings can be increased. We also propose an approach that can
   improve clustering performance and reduce the processing time by
   eliminating language-specific entities in the unified vector space.
   Experimental results on multilingual Twitter message clustering revealed
   that the proposed methods outperformed cross-lingual explicit semantic
   analysis, a previously proposed method to measure relatedness between
   texts in different languages. Moreover, the proposed methods were
   comparable to ENB applied to texts translated into English using a
   proprietary translation service. The proposed methods enabled
   relatedness measurements for multilingual short text clustering without
   requiring machine translation processes.}},

Title = {{Soft document clustering using a novel graph covering approach}},
Journal = {{BIODATA MINING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: In text mining, document clustering describes the efforts to
   assign unstructured documents to clusters, which in turn usually refer
   to topics. Clustering is widely used in science for data retrieval and
   organisation.
   Results: In this paper we present and discuss a novel graph-theoretical
   approach for document clustering and its application on a real-world
   data set. We will show that the well-known graph partition to stable
   sets or cliques can be generalized to pseudostable sets or
   pseudocliques. This allows to perform a soft clustering as well as a
   hard clustering. The software is freely available on GitHub.
   Conclusions: The presented integer linear programming as well as the
   greedy approach for this NP-complete problem lead to valuable results on
   random instances and some real-world data for different similarity
   measures. We could show that PS-Document Clustering is a remarkable
   approach to document clustering and opens the complete toolbox of graph
   theory to this field.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of globalization, companies need to capitalize on their
   knowledge. The knowledge of a company is present in two forms tacit and
   explicit. Explicit knowledge represents all formalized information i.e
   all documents (pdf,words...). Tacit knowledge is present in documents
   and mind of employees, this kind of knowledge is not formalized, it
   needs a reasoning process to discover it. In this paper, we propose a
   novel approach for documents clustering that is based on word clusters
   automatically extracted from the documents. The word concepts are
   considered as concepts candidates. In a second step, word clusters are
   used to ease the automatic building of ontologies from a given corpus.
   Some experiments allows for a validation of the whole approach. The
   chosen corpus is Reuters-21578 that is among the most used for text

Abstract = {{Document Clustering is the process of collecting similar kind of
   documents into one group based on any particular similarity function.
   Document clustering is also referred as text clustering. Informative
   features like phrases and their weights are considered to be more
   important to perform efficient document clustering. This paper mainly
   deals on two key parts for achieving efficient document clustering. The
   first part is a phrase based document model named as the Document
   Adjacency List, it explains about the construction of a phrase based
   model of the document set. It produces efficient phrase matching which
   is useful to decide the similarity among the documents. The second part
   is the document clustering algorithm that is proposed to enhance the
   Document Adjacency List for clustering based on the similarity measure.
   The combination of the above two parts leads to better calculation of
   similarity among documents and similarity further helps to calculate
   document clustering.}},

Abstract = {{An enormous quantity of textual documents is created from the advanced
   technological use concerning describing, intelligence, interconnection,

   process to organize the database on features. Outwardly implementing a
   clustering technique to textual data, a huge quantity of unstructured
   data is losing the capability of sharing knowledge. There are many tools

   document clustering algorithms (approaches) into two types are classical
   and modern approaches. Both approaches are implemented to those textual
   data to obtain and consolidate knowledge from discharged to an
   extraordinary impression of a prepared document. The two important
   factors in clustering process are speed of clustering process and
   accuracy or purity of data clusters. This review paper can be benefits

Abstract = {{Document clustering is an unsupervised process to group documents into
   the suitable category based on document's similarity. Before being
   clustered, generally set of documents are transformed into bag-of-words
   that was produced by preprocessing steps. Preprocessing is the initial
   steps that usually composed by case folding, tokenizing, stemming and
   filtering processes. But this traditionally bag-of-words representation
   have many drawbacks, such as the identification of synonym terms, high
   dimension and ineffective computation time. To resolve these problems,
   we propose the addition of functions in preprocessing stage. These
   additional functions are LSA, TF-IDF and the combination of TF-IDF/LSA
   function. Furthermore, these functions will be combined with synonym
   dictionary check function. The research uses 100 computer science
   documents in Bahasa Indonesia. The clustering process was implemented
   with K-Means clustering algorithm. According to the results, the
   addition of these functions will improved cluster accuracy compared to
   traditional preprocessing steps in document clustering. The experiment
   results also showed that the cluster accuracy was increasing while these
   functions were combined with synonym dictionary check function. The best
   accuracy achieved by the combination of TF-IDF/LSA with synonym
   dictionary check function in preprocessing stage. On the other hand, the
   addition of synonym dictionary check function has improved the
   completion time for clustering process as well. However, the addition of
   other functions such as TF-IDF, LSA or TF-IDF will cause longer
   completion time for clustering process.}},

Abstract = {{World Wide Web, the largest shared information source has a remarkable
   amount of text documents, which makes the document clustering as one of
   the ideal areas of research these days. To navigate, summarize and
   retrieve the information effectively, document clustering can facilitate
   the automatic document organization. To attain the basic objective of
   document clustering, i.e. clustered documents should have high
   intra-similarity rate and low inter-similarity rate to other clusters,
   several techniques are proposed. The basic categorization of document
   clustering techniques is done into two: partitional and hierarchical
   techniques. However, the partitional clustering techniques are extremely
   popular in document clustering area. The K-means inspired algorithms are
   the most efficient and fast partitional clustering algorithms, which
   seeks to divide documents collection into separate groups to look for
   the optimized value of clustering. Cluster grouping techniques
   frequently experience scalability, high dimensionality, and inaccurate
   cluster labels issues. This paper modifies the clustering scheme, using
   Universal Networking Language (UNL) generative feature vector,
   Subtractive Clustering approach combined with Boundary Restricted
   Particle Swarm Optimization (BR-APSO) algorithm for efficient document
   clustering. The proposed method not only compares but analyses the
   existing document clustering methodologies and improves entropy and

Abstract = {{Short text clustering is a popular problem that focuses on the
   unsupervised grouping of similar short text documents, or entitled
   entities. Since the short texts are currently being utilized in a vast
   number of applications, the problem in question has been rendered
   increasingly significant in the past few years. The high cluster
   homogeneity and completeness are two among the most important goals of
   all data clustering algorithms. However, in the context of short texts,
   their fulfilment is particularly difficult, because this type of data is
   typically represented by sparse vectors that collectively comprise a
   very high dimensional space. In this article we introduce VEPHC, a
   two-stage clustering algorithm designed to confront the sparseness and
   high dimensionality traits of short texts. During the first stage (or
   else, the VEP part), the initial feature vectors are projected onto a
   lower dimensional space by constructing and scoring variable-sized
   combinations of features (that is, terms). In the second stage (or else,
   the HC part), VEPHC improves the homogeneity and completeness of the
   generated clusters through split and merge operations that are based on
   the similarities of all inter-cluster elements. The experimental
   evaluation of VEPHC on two real-world datasets demonstrates its superior
   performance over numerous state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in
   terms of F1 scores and Normalized Mutual Information.}},

Abstract = {{A feature word vector based on short text clustering algorithm is
   proposed in this paper to solve the poor clustering of short text caused
   by sparse feature and quick updates of short text. Firstly, the formula
   for feature word extraction based on word part-of-speech (POS) weighting
   is defined and used to extract a feature word as short text. Secondly,
   the word vector that represents the semantics of the feature word was
   obtained through training in large-scale corpus with the Continuous
   Skip-gram Model. Finally, Word Mover's Distance (WMD) was used to
   calculate similarity of short texts for short text clustering in the
   hierarchical clustering algorithm. The evaluation of four testing
   datasets revealed that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior
   to traditional clustering algorithms, with a mean F value of 55.43\% on

Abstract = {{Proliferation of web as an easily accessible information resource has
   led many corporations to gather competitor intelligence from the
   internet. While collection of such information is easy from internet,
   the collation and structuring of them for perusal of business decision
   makers, is a real trouble. Text clustering based topic identification
   techniques are expected to be very useful for such application. Using
   appropriate clustering technologies, the competitor intelligence corpus,
   gathered from the web, can be divided into topical groups and henceforth
   the analysis of this information becomes comparatively easier for the
   managers. This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of standard
   K-means text clustering algorithm applied at multiple levels, in a
   top-down, divide-and-conquer fashion, on competitor intelligence corpus,
   created from publicly available sources on the web, such as news, blogs,
   research papers etc. The paper also demonstrates the capability of
   Multi-level K-means (ML-KM) clustering technique to determine the
   optimal number of clusters as part of clustering process. The cluster
   validity metric used to determine cluster quality has also been
   explained along with other user-controlled configuration parameters. It
   is empirically found that ML-KM technique also addresses one problem of
   stand-alone standard K-means (S-KM), which is its bias towards convex,
   spherical clusters, resulting in bigger clusters subsuming smaller ones.
   This specific advantage of ML-KM over stand-alone S-KM to detect smaller
   clusters, makes it more suitable for clustering competitor intelligence
   related text corpus where niche, smaller clusters can actually lead to
   important findings. The experimental results are presented for both
   ML-KM and stand-alone S-KM clustering techniques based on competitor
   intelligence corpus as well as the standard Reuters corpus.}},

Abstract = {{In similarity-based constrained clustering, there have been various
   approaches on how to define the similarity between documents to guide
   the grouping of similar documents together. This paper presents an
   approach to use term-distribution statistics extracted from a small
   number of cue instances with their known classes, for term weightings as
   indirect distance constraint. As for distribution-based term weighting,
   three types of term-oriented standard deviations are exploited:
   distribution of a term in a collection (SD), average distribution of a
   term in a class (ACSD), and average distribution of a term among classes
   (CSD). These term weightings are explored with the consideration of
   symmetry concepts by varying the magnitude to positive and negative for
   promoting and demoting effects of three standard deviations. In k-means,
   followed the symmetry concept, both seeded and unseeded centroid
   initializations are investigated and compared to the centroid-based
   classification. Our experiment is conducted using five English text
   collections and one Thai text collection, i.e., Amazon, DI, WebKB1,
   WebKB2, and 20Newsgroup, as well as TR, a collection of Thai
   reform-related opinions. Compared to the conventional TFIDF, the
   distribution-based term weighting improves the centroid-based method,
   seeded k-means, and k-means with the error reduction rate of 22.45\%,
   31.13\%, and 58.96\%.}},

Title = {{An improved bee colony optimization algorithm with an application to
   document clustering}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{9-26}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{The bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm is proved to be one of the
   fast, robust and efficient global search heuristics in tackling
   different practical problems. Considering BCO algorithm in this paper,
   we utilize it for the data clustering, a fundamental problem that
   frequently arises in many applications. However, we discovered some
   obstacles in directly applying the ancient BCO to address the clustering
   problem and managed to change some basic behaviors of this swarm
   algorithm. In particular, we present an improved bee colony optimization
   algorithm, dubbed IBCO, by introducing cloning and fairness concepts
   into the BCO algorithm and make it more efficient for data clustering.
   These features give BCO very powerful and balanced exploration and
   exploitation capabilities to effectively guide the search process toward
   the proximity of the high quality solutions. In particular, the cloning
   feature allows it to take advantage of experiences gained from previous
   generations when generating new solutions. The problem of getting stuck
   in local optima still laid bare in the proposed improved version. As a
   result, to overcome the shortage of this swarm algorithm in searching
   locally, we hybridize it with the k-means algorithm to take advantage of
   fine tuning power of the widely used k-means algorithm which
   demonstrates good result in local searches. We propose four different
   hybridized algorithms based on IBCO and k-means algorithms and
   investigate the clustering results and convergence behavior of them. We
   empirically demonstrate that our hybrid algorithms alleviate the problem
   of sticking in a local solution even for large and high dimensional data
   sets such as document clustering. The results show that proposed
   algorithms are robust enough to be used in many applications compared to
   k-means and other recently proposed evolutionary based clustering
   algorithms including genetic, particle swarm optimization, ant colony,
   and bee based algorithms. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Multitasking and interruptions in information work make frequent
   activity switches necessary. Individuals need to recall and restore
   earlier states of work which generally involves retrieval of information
   objects. To avoid resulting tooling time an activity-centric
   organization of information objects has been proposed. For each activity
   a collection with related information objects ( like documents, websites
   etc.)is created to improve information access and serve as a memory aid.
   While the manual maintenance of such information collections is a
   tedious task and becomes an interruption on its own, the automatic
   maintenance of such collections using activity mining is promising.
   Activity mining utilizes interaction histories to extract unique
   activities based on the stream of interaction with information objects.
   For activity mining, existing work shows varying success in limited
   study setups.
   In this paper, we present a method for activity mining to generate
   activity-centric information object collections automatically from
   interaction histories. The technique is a hybrid approach considering
   all information types used in previous work - activity stream and
   accessed content related information. Method performance is evaluated
   based on interaction histories collected during real work data from
   eight information workers collected over several weeks. For the dataset
   our hybrid approach shows on average a performance of 0.53 ARI up to
   0.77 ARI, outperforming single metric-based approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering usually deals with clustering of documents that

   documents on the basis of similarities. The input will be the collection
   of documents consisting of multi topic segments taken from web.
   SentiWordNet has been used to calculate the segment score of the
   segments within the documents. Based upon the segment score segment
   based clustering is performed on the intra-document level. Once we are
   done with intra-document segment based clustering then k-means approach
   is applied to the entire collection of documents to perform
   inter-document clustering in which the similar segments of various
   documents will be clustered under a single cluster. Our proposed
   technique would help in efficient organization of multi topic documents

Abstract = {{Existing approaches for text clustering are either agglomerative,
   divisive or based on frequent itemsets. However, most of the suggested
   solutions do not take the semantic associations between words into
   account and documents are only regarded as bags of unrelated words.
   Indeed, traditional text clustering methods usually focus on the
   frequency of terms in documents to create connected homogenous clusters
   without considering associated semantic which will of course lead to
   inaccurate clustering results. Accordingly, this research aims to
   understand the meanings of text phrases in the process of clustering to
   make maximum usage and use of documents. The semantic web framework is
   filled with useful techniques enabling database use to be substantial.
   The goal is to exploit these techniques to the full usage of the
   Resource Description Framework (RDF) to represent textual data as
   triplets. To come up a more effective clustering method, we provide a
   semantic representation of the data in texts on which the clustering
   process would be based. On the other hand, this study opts to implement
   other techniques within the clustering process such as ontology
   representation to manipulate and extract meaningful information using
   RDF, RDF Schemas (RDFS), and Web Ontology Language (OWL). Since Text
   clustering is an indispensable task for better exploitation of
   documents, the use of documents may be more intelligently conducted
   while considering semantics in the process of text clustering to
   efficiently identify the more related groups in a document collection.
   To this end, the proposed framework combines multiple techniques to come
   up with an efficient approach combining machine learning tools with
   semantic web principles. The framework allows documents RDF
   representation, clustering, topic modeling, clusters summarizing,
   information retrieval based on RDF querying and Reasoning tools. It also
   highlights the advantages of using semantic web techniques in
   clustering, subject modeling and knowledge extraction based on processes
   of questioning, reasoning and inferencing.}},

Abstract = {{An Adaptive Crossover Memetic Differential Harmony Search (ACMDHS)
   method was developed for optimizing document clustering in this paper.
   Due to the complexity of the documents available today, the allocation
   of the centroid of the document clusters and finding the optimum
   clusters in the search space are more complex to deal with. One of the
   possible enhancements on the document clustering is the use of Harmony
   Search (HS) algorithm to optimize the search. As HS is highly dependent
   on its control parameters, a differential version of HS was introduced.
   In the modified version of HS, the Band Width parameter (BW) has been
   replaced by another pitch adjustment technique due to the sensitivity of
   the BW parameter. Thus, the Differential Evolution (DE) mutation was
   used instead. In this paper the DE crossover was also used with the
   Differential HS for further search space exploitation, the produced
   global search is named Crossover DHS (CDHS). Moreover, DE crossover (Cr)
   and mutation (F) probabilities are dynamically tuned through
   generations. The Memetic optimization was used to enhance the local
   search capability of CDHS. The proposed ACMDHS was compared to other
   document clustering techniques using HS, DHS, and K-means methods. It
   was also compared to its other two variants which are the Memetic DHS
   (MDHS) and the Crossover Memetic Differential Harmony Search (CMDHS).
   Moreover, two state-of-the-art clustering methods were also considered
   in comparisons, the Chaotic Gradient Artificial Bee Colony (CGABC) and
   the Differential Evolution Memetic Clustering (DEMC). From the
   experimental results, it was shown that CMDHS variant (the non-adaptive
   version of ACMDHS) and ACMDHS were highly competitive while both CMDHS
   and ACMDHS were superior to all other methods.}},

Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},

Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Constrained clustering is intended to improve accuracy and
   personalization based on the constraints expressed by an Oracle. In this
   paper, a new constrained clustering algorithm is proposed and some of
   the informative data pairs are selected during an iterative process.
   Then, they are presented to the Oracle and their relation is answered
   with ``Must-link (ML) or Cannot-link (CL).{''} In each iteration, first,
   the support vector machine (SVM) is utilized based on the label produced
   by the current clustering. According to the distance of each document
   from the hyperplane, the distance matrix is created. Also, based on
   cosine similarity of word2vector of each document, the similarity matrix
   is created. Two types of probability (similarity and degree of
   similarity) are calculated and they are smoothed for belonging to
   neighborhoods. Neighborhoods form the samples that are labeled by
   Oracle, to be in the same cluster. Finally, at the end of each
   iteration, the data with a greater level of uncertainty (in term of
   probability) is selected for questioning the oracle. In order to
   evaluate, the proposed method is compared with famous state-of-the-art
   methods based on two criteria and over a standard dataset. The result
   demonstrates an increased accuracy and stability of the obtained result

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{The text clustering is considered as one of the most effective text
   document analysis methods, which is applied to cluster documents as a
   consequence of the expanded big data and online information. Based on
   the review of the related work of the text clustering algorithms, these
   algorithms achieved reasonable clustering results for some datasets,
   while they failed on a wide variety of benchmark datasets. Furthermore,
   the performance of these algorithms was not robust due to the
   inefficient balance between the exploitation and exploration
   capabilities of the clustering algorithm. Accordingly, this research
   proposes a Memetic Differential Evolution algorithm (MDETC) to solve the
   text clustering problem, which aims to address the effect of the
   hybridization between the differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy
   with the memetic algorithm (MA). This hybridization intends to enhance
   the quality of text clustering and improve the exploitation and
   exploration capabilities of the algorithm. Our experimental results
   based on six standard text clustering benchmark datasets (i.e. the
   Laboratory of Computational Intelligence (LABIC)) have shown that the
   MDETC algorithm outperformed other compared clustering algorithms based
   on AUC metric, F-measure, and the statistical analysis. Furthermore, the
   MDETC is compared with the state of art text clustering algorithms and
   obtained almost the best results for the standard benchmark datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Arabic Text document clustering is an important aspect for providing
   conjectural navigation and browsing techniques by organizing massive
   amounts of data into a small number of defined clusters. However, Words
   in form of vector are used for clustering methods is often
   unsatisfactory as it ignores relationships between important terms.
   Cluster analysis separates data into groups on clusters for the purposes
   of improved understanding or summarization. Clustering has a long
   history and many techniques developed in statistics, data mining,
   pattern recognition and other fields. This research proposes three
   approaches; Unsupervised, Semi Supervised techniques and Semi Supervised
   with dimensionality reduction to construct a clustering based classifier
   for Arabic text documents. Using k-means, incremental k-means, Threshold
   + k-means and k-means with dimensionality reduction, after document
   preprocessing removing stop words and gets the root for each term in
   each document. Then apply a term weighting method to get the weight of
   each term with respect to its document. Then apply a similarity measure
   method to each document and its similarity with other documents. And
   using F-measure, entropy and support vector machine (SVM) for calculate
   accuracy. The datasets are online dynamic datasets that are
   characterized by its availability and credibility on the internet.
   Arabic language is a challenging language when applied in an inference
   based algorithm. So, selecting the appropriate dataset is a principal
   factor in such research. The accuracy of those methods compared with
   other approaches and the proposed methods shows better accuracy and
   fewer errors for new classification test cases. Considering that the
   dimension reduction process is very sensitive because increasing the
   ratio of reduction can destroy important terms.}},

Abstract = {{Several steps need to be considered when conducting a data mining study
   on a text dataset, this will also involve the use of multiple techniques
   before achieving any results or extracting any hidden knowledge. Hence,
   the complexity of working with text data. One of the main steps would be
   the pre-processing of the text dataset, and this might include multiple
   techniques such as tokenisation, word stemming, stop words removal, and
   text vectorisation. To extract knowledge from the text data after
   preprocessing, depending on the use case or end goal, the application
   steps might include clustering of text documents, classification of the
   text documents, and the extraction of document topics and entities. For
   each of these steps there are several methods and techniques being
   presented in different research studies. In this paper we present a
   framework that would categorise, cluster and classify a corpus of
   unclassified documents. The framework extracts named entities and uses a
   linked data Knowledge Graph to assign several topics and categories to
   each document. Then automatically cluster the documents into groups
   using the K-Mean model with the Elbow and Silhouette methods. Each
   cluster then gets assigned to a readable name from the extracted linked
   data based on word frequency in each cluster.}},

Abstract = {{To tackle the sparse data problem of the bag-of-words model for document
   clustering, recent strategies have been proposed to enrich a document
   with the relatedness of all the words in a corpus to the document, where
   the relatedness is estimated by the weighted sum of word co-occurrences.
   However, the relatedness is overestimated without eliminating the
   overlaps between word co-occurrences. This paper demonstrates that the
   weighted sum strategy gives the upper bound of the theoretic degree of
   relatedness. Two strategies are further proposed to approach the
   theoretic degree of relatedness. The first strategy is established under
   the extreme assumption that all the words in a document co-occur with
   each other. By considering the specificities of words, the second
   strategy gives several extended versions of the weighted sum strategy.
   Substantial experiments verify that the document clustering incorporated
   with the extended strategies achieve a significant performance
   improvement compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.}},

   through grouping of crime-related documents. This paper proposes a
   Memetic Algorithm Feature Selection (MAFS) approach to enhance the
   performance of document clustering algorithms used to partition crime
   reports and criminal news as well as some benchmark text datasets. Two
   clustering algorithms have been selected to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed MAFS method; they are the k-means and
   Spherical k-means (Spk). The reason behind using these clustering
   methods Is to observe the performance of these algorithms before and
   after applying a hybrid FS that uses a Memetic scheme. The proposed MAFS
   method combines a Genetic Algorithm-based wrapper FS with the Relief-F
   filter. The performance evaluation was based on the clustering outcomes
   before and after applying the proposed MAFS method. The test results
   showed that the performance of both k-means and spk improved after the
   MAFS.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing amount of text documents in digital forms affect the text
   analysis techniques. Text clustering (TC) is one of the important
   techniques used for showing a massive amount of text documents by
   clusters. Hence, the main problem that affects the text clustering
   technique is the presence sparse and uninformative features on the text
   documents. The feature selection (FS) is an essential unsupervised
   learning technique. This technique is used to select informative
   features to improve the performance of text clustering algorithm.
   Recently, the meta-heuristic algorithms are successfully applied to
   solve several hard optimization problems. In this paper, we proposed the
   genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the unsupervised feature selection
   problem, namely, (FSGATC). This method is used to create a new subset of
   informative features in order to obtain more accurate clusters.
   Experiments were conducted using four benchmark text datasets with
   variant characteristics. The resuIts showed that the proposed FSGATC is
   improved the performance of the text clustering algorithm and got better
   results compared with k-mean clustering standalone. Finally, the
   proposed method ``FSGATC{''} evaluated by F-measure and Accuracy, which
   are common measures used in the domain of text clustering.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that
   separates a large subject heterogeneous collection (Corpus) into
   smaller, more manageable, subject homogeneous collections (clusters).
   Traditional method of document clustering works around extracting
   textual features like: terms, sequences, and phrases from documents.
   These features are independent of each other and do not cater meaning
   behind these word in the clustering process. In order to perform
   semantic viable clustering, we believe that the problem of document
   clustering has two main components: (1) to represent the document in
   such a form that it inherently captures semantics of the text. This may
   also help to reduce dimensionality of the document and (2) to define a
   similarity measure based on the lexical, syntactic and semantic features
   such that it assigns higher numerical values to document pairs which
   have higher syntactic and semantic relationship. In this paper, we
   propose a representation of document by extracting three different types
   of features from a given document. These are lexical alpha, syntactic
   beta and semantic gamma features. A meta-descriptor for each document is
   proposed using these three features: first lexical, then syntactic and
   in the last semantic. A document to document similarity matrix is
   produced where each entry of this matrix contains a three value vector
   for each lexical alpha, syntactic beta and semantic gamma. The main
   contributions from this research are (i) A document level descriptor
   using three different features for text like: lexical, syntactic and
   semantics. (ii) we propose a similarity function using these three, and
   (iii) we define a new candidate clustering algorithm using three
   component of similarity measure to guide the clustering process in a
   direction that produce more semantic rich clusters. We performed an
   extensive series of experiments on standard text mining data sets with
   external clustering evaluations like: F-Measure and Purity, and have
   obtained encouraging results.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional text document clustering methods represent documents with
   uncontextualized word embeddings and vector space model, which neglect
   the polysemy and the semantic relation between words. This paper
   presents a novel text document clustering method to deal with these
   problems. Firstly, pre-trained language representation model
   Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is
   utilized to generate sentence embeddings. Then, two sentence-level
   weighting schemes based on named entity are designed to enhance the
   performance. Finally, the k-means clustering algorithm is applied to
   find groups of similar documents. Experimental results on four datasets
   indicate that the proposed weighted method achieves higher accuracy than
   unweighted average method. Friedman tests conducted separately with F1
   score and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) values both validate better overall
   performance of our proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Organizing web information is an important aspect of finding information

   proposed method. The experimental results indicated that dividing the
   documents into fixed segments is preferable to dividing them into
   logical segments based on HTML features because the web pages do not
   have the same structure. Mean TF-IDF reduction technique gives the best
   results in most cases. WeDoCWT gives F-measure better than most of the
   previous approaches described in the literature. We used Munkres
   assignment algorithm to assign each produced cluster to the original

Abstract = {{Efficient document clustering plays an important role in organizing and
   browsing the information in the World Wide Web. K-means is the most
   popular clustering algorithms, due to its simplicity and efficiency.
   However, it may be trapped in local minimum which leads to poor results.
   Recently, cuckoo search based clustering has proved to reach interesting
   results. By against, the number of iterations can increase dramatically
   due to its slowness convergence. In this paper, we propose an improved
   cuckoo search clustering algorithm in order to overcome the weakness of
   the conventional cuckoo search clustering. In this algorithm, the global
   search procedure is enhanced by a local search method. The experiments
   tests on four text document datasets and one standard dataset extracted

   the proposed algorithm to improve significantly the clustering quality

Abstract = {{Search queries define a set of documents located in a collection and can
   be used to rank the documents by assigning each document a score
   according to their closeness to the query in the multidimensional space
   of weighted terms. In this paper, we describe a system whereby an island
   model genetic algorithm (GA) creates individuals which can generate a
   set of Apache Lucene search queries for the purpose of text document
   clustering. A cluster is specified by the documents returned by a single
   query in the set. Each document that is included in only one of the
   clusters adds to the fitness of the individual and each document that is
   included in more than one cluster will reduce the fitness. The method
   can be refined by using the ranking score of each document in the
   fitness test. The system has a number of advantages; in particular, the
   final search queries are easily understood and offer a simple
   explanation of the clusters, meaning that an extra cluster labelling
   stage is not required. We describe how the GA can be used to build
   queries and show results for clustering on various data sets and with
   different query sizes. Results are also compared with clusters built
   using the widely used k-means algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Text Mining is a field that is considered as an extension of data
   mining. In the context of text mining, document clustering is used to
   set apart likewise documents of a collection into the identical
   category, called cluster, and divergent documents to distinctive groups.
   Since every dataset has its own characteristics, finding an appropriate
   clustering algorithm that can manage all kinds of clusters, is a big
   challenge. Clustering algorithms has theirs unique approaches for
   computing the number of clusters, imposing a structure on the data, and
   attesting the out coming clusters. The idea of combining different
   clustering is an effort to overwhelm the faults of single algorithms and
   further enhance their executions. On the other hand, inspired by the
   gravitational law, different clustering algorithms have been introduced
   that each one attempted to cluster complex datasets. Gravitational
   Ensemble Clustering (GEC) is an ensemble method that employs both the
   concepts of gravitational clustering and ensemble clustering to reach a
   better clustering result. This paper represents an application of GEC to
   the problem of document clustering. The proposed method uses a
   modification of the original GEC algorithm. This modification tries to
   produce a more varied clustering ensemble using new parameter setting.
   The GEC algorithm is assessed using document datasets. Promising results
   of the presented method were obtained in comparison with competing
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The size of WWW is growing exponentially with ever change in technology.
   This results in huge amount of information with long list of URLs.
   Manually it is not possible to visit each page individually. So, if the
   page ranking algorithms are used properly then user search space can be
   restricted up to some pages of searched results. But available
   literatures show that no single search system can provide qualitative
   results from all the domains. This paper provides solution to this
   problemby introducing a new meta search engine that determine the
   relevancy of query corresponding to web page and cluster the results
   accordingly. The proposed approach reduces the user efforts, improves
   the quality of results and performance of the meta search engine.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposed a soft computing approach to solve document
   clustering problem. Document clustering is a specialized clustering
   problem in which textual documents autonomously segregated to a number
   of identifiable, subject homogenous and smaller sub-collections (also
   called clusters). Identifying implicit textual patterns within the
   documents is a challenging aspect as there can be thousands of such
   textual features. Partition clustering algorithm like k-means is mainly
   used for this problem. There are several drawbacks in k-means algorithm
   such as (i) initial seeds dependency, and (ii) it traps into local
   optimal solution. Although every k-means solution may contain some good
   partial arrangements for clustering. Meta-heuristic algorithm like Black
   Hole (BH) uses certain trade-off of randomization and local search for
   finding the optimal and near optimal solution. Our motivation comes from
   the fact that meta-heuristic optimization can quickly produce a global
   optimal solution using random k-means initial solution. The
   contributions from this research are (i) an implementation of black hole
   algorithm using k-mean as embedding (ii) The phenomena of global search
   and local search optimization are used as parameters adjustments. A
   series of experiments are performed with our proposed method on standard
   text mining datasetslike: (i) NEWS20, (ii) Reuters and (iii) WebKB and
   results are evaluated on Purity and Silhouette Index. In comparison the
   proposed method outperforms the basic k-means, GA with k-means embedding
   and quickly converges to global or near global optimal solution.}},

Title = {{Topic attention encoder: A self-supervised approach for short text
   clustering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Short text clustering is a challenging and important task in many
   practical applications. However, many Bag-of-Word-based methods for
   short text clustering are often limited by the sparsity of text
   representation, while many sentence embedding-based methods fail to
   capture the document structure dependencies within a text corpus. In
   considerations of the shortcomings of many existing studies, a topic
   attention encoder (TAE) is proposed in this study. Given topics derived
   from corpus by the techniques of topic modelling, the cross-document
   information is introduced. This encoder assumes the document-topic
   vector to be the learning target and the concatenating vectors of the
   word embedding and corresponding topic-word vector to be the input.
   Also, a self-attention mechanism is employed in the encoder, which aims
   to extract weights of hidden states adaptively and encode the semantics
   of each short text document. With captured global dependencies and local
   semantics, TAE integrates the superiority of Bag-of-Word methods and
   sentence embedding methods. Finally, categories of benchmarking
   experiments were conducted by analysing three public data sets. It
   demonstrates that the proposed TAE outperforms many document
   representation benchmark methods for short text clustering.}},

Abstract = {{Short documents are typically represented by very sparse vectors, in the
   space of terms. In this case, traditional techniques for calculating
   text similarity results in measures which are very close to zero, since
   documents even the very similar ones have a very few or mostly no terms
   in common. In order to alleviate this limitation, the representation of
   short-text segments should be enriched by incorporating information
   about correlation between terms. In other words, if two short segments
   do not have any common words, but terms from the first segment appear
   frequently with terms from the second segment in other documents, this
   means that these segments are semantically related, and their similarity
   measure should be high. Towards achieving this goal, we employ a method
   for enhancing document clustering using statistical semantics. However,
   the problem of high computation time arises when calculating correlation
   between all terms. In this work, we propose the selection of a few
   terms, and using these terms with the Nystrom method to approximate the
   term-term correlation matrix. The selection of the terms for the Nystrom
   method is performed by randomly sampling terms with probabilities
   proportional to the lengths of their vectors in the document space. This
   allows more important terms to have more influence on the approximation
   of the term-term correlation matrix and accordingly achieves better
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic-based text document clustering aims to group documents into a
   set of topic clusters. We propose a new approach for semantically
   clustering of text documents based on cognitive science and graph
   theory. We apply a computational cognitive model of semantic association
   for human semantic memory, known as Incremental Construction of an
   Associative Network (ICAN). The vector-based model of Latent Semantic
   Analysis (LSA), has been a leading computational cognitive model for
   semantic learning and topic modeling, but it has well-known limitations
   including not considering the original word-order and doing semantic
   reduction with neither a linguistic nor cognitive basis. These issues
   have been overcome by the ICAN model. ICAN model is used to generate
   document-level semantic-graphs. Cognitive and graph-based topic and
   context identification methods are used for semantic reduction of ICAN
   graphs. A corpus-graph is generated from ICAN graphs, and then a
   community-detection graph algorithm is applied for the final step of
   document clustering. Experiments are conducted on three commonly used
   datasets. Using the purity and entropy criteria for clustering quality,
   our results show a notable outperformance over the LSA-based approach.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the volume of information in digital form has increased
   tremendously owing to the increased popularity of the World Wide Web. As
   a result, the use of techniques for extracting useful information from
   large collections of data, and particularly documents, has become more
   necessary and challenging. Text clustering is such a technique; it
   consists in dividing a set of text documents into clusters (groups), so
   that documents within the same cluster are closely related, whereas
   documents in different clusters are as different as possible. Clustering
   depends on measuring the content (i.e., words) of a document in terms of
   relevance. Nevertheless, as documents usually contain a large number of
   words, some of them may be irrelevant to the topic under consideration
   or redundant. This can confuse and complicate the clustering process and
   make it less accurate. Accordingly, feature selection methods have been
   employed to reduce data dimensionality by selecting the most relevant
   features. In this study, we developed a text document clustering
   optimization model using a novel genetic frog-leaping algorithm that
   efficiently clusters text documents based on selected features. The
   proposed approach is based on two metaheuristic algorithms: a genetic
   algorithm (GA) and a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA). The GA
   performs feature selection, and the SFLA performs clustering. To
   evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed approach was tested on a
   well-known text document dataset: the ``20Newsgroup{''} dataset from the
   University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Overall,
   after multiple experiments were compared and analyzed, it was
   demonstrated that using the proposed algorithm on the 20Newsgroup
   dataset greatly facilitated text document clustering, compared with
   classical K-means clustering. Nevertheless, this improvement requires
   longer computational time.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays emails have been an easy and fast tool of communication among
   people. As a result, filtering unsolicited/spam emails has become a very
   important challenge to achieve. Recently there has been some research
   work in text mining that combines text clustering with classification to
   improve the classification performance. In this paper, we investigate
   the effect of combining text clustering using K-means algorithm with
   various supervised classification mechanisms on improving the
   performance of classification of emails into spam or non-spam. The
   conjunction of clustering and classification mechanisms is carried out
   by adding extra features from the clustering step to the feature space
   used for classification. Our results show that combining K-means
   clustering with supervised classification by this methodology does not
   always improve the classification performance. Moreover, for the cases
   that the classifiers performance is improved by clustering, we found
   that the performance of classifiers in terms of accuracy is slightly
   increased with a very small amount that does not meet the increase in
   the time taken for building a learning model that combines both
   mechanisms. The result of our experiment has been shown using the
   Enron-Spam datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Krill herd (KH) algorithm is a novel swarm-based optimization algorithm
   that imitates krill herding behavior during the searching for foods. It
   has been successfully used in solving many complex optimization
   problems. The potency of this algorithm is very high because of its
   superior performance compared with other optimization algorithms. Hence,
   the applicability of this algorithm for text document clustering is
   investigated in this work. Text document clustering refers to the method
   of clustering an enormous amount of text documents into coherent and
   dense clusters, where documents in the same cluster are similar. In this
   paper, a combination of objective functions and hybrid KH algorithm,
   called, MHKHA, is proposed to solve the text document clustering
   problem. In this version, the initial solutions of the KH algorithm are
   inherited from the k-mean clustering algorithm and the clustering
   decision is based on two combined objective functions. Nine text
   standard datasets collected from the Laboratory of Computational
   Intelligence are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   algorithms. Five evaluation measures are employed, namely, accuracy,
   precision, recall, F-measure, and convergence behavior. The proposed
   versions of the KH algorithm are compared with other well-known
   clustering algorithms and other thirteen published algorithms in the
   literature. The MHKHA obtained the best results for all evaluation

Abstract = {{Inspired by the success of a recently developed algorithm MVSC-I R, the
   authors embed the idea of Multi0Viewpoint Based Similarity Measure for
   clustering (MVSC) into a hierarchical clustering method, i.e., average
   linkage clustering, to overcome the problem of initiation with random
   seeds, resulting in a new algorithm, referred to as MVSC-HAC. The
   improved performance of this new algorithm encouraged us to further
   explore the impact of metadata in document clustering. In this paper,
   after reviewing two existing algorithms, the authors describe their new
   algorithm and present experimental results on various sizes of data sets
   at two different levels: the one using the entire context of documents

Abstract = {{Feature dimensionality has always been one of the key challenges in text
   mining as it increases complexity when mining documents with high

   reduction is usually addressed by implementing either feature reduction
   or feature selection techniques. In this work, the problem of
   dimensionality reduction is addressed using singular value decomposition
   and the results are compared to information gain approach through
   retaining top-k features. High dimensional clustering is carried by
   using k-means algorithm with gaussian function. The proposed

Abstract = {{In this article, we examine an algorithm for document clustering using a
   similarity graph. The graph stores words and common phrases from the
   English language as nodes and it can be used to compute the degree of
   semantic similarity between any two phrases. One application of the
   similarity graph is semantic document clustering, that is, grouping
   documents based on the meaning of the words in them. Since our algorithm
   for semantic document clustering relies on multiple parameters, we
   examine how fine-tuning these values affects the quality of the result.
   Specifically, we use the Reuters-21578 benchmark, which contains 11; 362
   newswire stories that are grouped in 82 categories using human judgment.
   We apply the k-means clustering algorithm to group the documents using a
   similarity metric that is based on keywords matching and one that uses
   the similarity graph. We evaluate the results of the clustering
   algorithms using multiple metrics, such as precision, recall, f-score,
   entropy, and purity.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is the application of cluster analysis to textual
   documents. It is commonly used technique in data mining, information
   retrieval, knowledge discovery from data, pattern recognition, etc. In
   traditional document clustering, a document is considered as a bag of
   words; where semantic meaning of word is not taken into consideration.
   However, to achieve accurate document clustering, feature such as
   meanings of the words is important. Document clustering can be done
   using semantic approach because it takes semantic relationship among
   words into account. This paper highlights the problems in traditional
   approach as well as semantic approach. This paper identifies four major
   areas under semantic clustering and presents a survey of 23 papers that
   are studied, covering major significant work. Moreover, this paper also
   provides a survey of tools specifically used for text processing, and
   clustering algorithms, that help in applying and evaluating document
   clustering. The presented survey is used in preparing the proposed work
   in the same direction. This proposed work uses the sense of a word for
   text clustering system. Lexical chains will be used as features that are
   to be developed using the identity/synonymy relation from WordNet
   ontology as background knowledge. Later, clustering will be done using
   the lexical chains.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, several studies have demonstrated the importance
   of co-clustering to simultaneously produce groups of objects and
   features. Even to obtain object clusters only, using co-clustering is
   often more effective than one-way clustering, especially when
   considering sparse high dimensional data. In this paper, we present a
   novel generative mixture model for co-clustering such data. This model,
   the Sparse Poisson Latent Block Model (SPLBM), is based on the Poisson
   distribution, which arises naturally for contingency tables, such as
   document-term matrices. The advantages of SPLBM are two-fold. First, it
   is a rigorous statistical model which is also very parsimonious. Second,
   it has been designed from the ground up to deal with data sparsity
   problems. As a consequence, in addition to seeking homogeneous blocks,
   as other available algorithms, it also filters out homogeneous but noisy
   ones due to the sparsity of the data. Experiments on various datasets of
   different size and structure show that an algorithm based on SPLBM
   clearly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Most notably, the
   SPLBM-based algorithm presented here succeeds in retrieving the natural
   cluster structure of difficult, unbalanced datasets which other known
   algorithms are unable to handle effectively.}},

   Overlap Detection}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{S55-S74}},
Abstract = {{Humans are used to expressing themselves with written language and
   language provides a medium with which we can describe our experiences in
   detail incorporating individuality. Even though documents provide a rich
   source of information, it becomes very difficult to identify, extract,
   summarize and search when vast amounts of documents are collected
   especially over time. Document clustering is a technique that has been
   widely used to group documents based on similarity of content
   represented by the words used. Once key groups are identified further
   drill down into sub-groupings is facilitated by the use of hierarchical
   clustering. Clustering and hierarchical clustering are very useful when
   applied to numerical and categorical data and cluster accuracy and
   purity measures exist to evaluate the outcomes of a clustering exercise.
   Although the same measures have been applied to text clustering, text
   clusters are based on words or terms which can be repeated across
   documents associated with different topics. Therefore text data cannot
   be considered as a direct `coding' of a particular experience or
   situation in contrast to numerical and categorical data and term overlap
   is a very common characteristic in text clustering. In this paper we
   propose a new technique and methodology for term overlap capture from
   text documents, highlighting the different situations such overlap could
   signify and discuss why such understanding is important for obtaining
   value from text clustering. Experiments were conducted using a widely
   used text document collection where the proposed methodology allowed
   exploring the term diversity for a given document collection and obtain
   clusters with minimum term overlap.}},

Abstract = {{The world wide web also known as WWW is the source for the largest
   shared information. To effectively organize, summarize and navigate
   through the information on the web in a fast and high quality manner,
   document clustering algorithms are needed. Various clustering algorithms
   are proposed by the researchers in which the K-means is widely used
   partitioning clustering algorithm which is easy for implementation, has
   fast convergence property in local area, and takes less time for
   execution. But major drawback of this method is its random choice of
   initial cluster centroids. To overcome this problem, an approach for
   document clustering using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is
   proposed in this paper. PSO method is applied before K-means for finding
   the optimal points in the search space and these points are used as
   initial cluster centroids for K-means algorithm to find final clusters
   of documents. Results of clustering algorithms are tested on four
   different document datasets. The outcome shows that the most efficient
   clustering results are generated than traditional K-means algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Finding useful and relevant information is a very challenging task to
   the user. The retrieval system usually responded with a long listed
   documents which are not necessarily relevant to the user's need.
   Document clustering is a special technique that can sort out the
   documents effectively so that documents in the same cluster are similar
   to each other and documents in different cluster are dissimilar to each
   other. This paper focuses on document clustering for Malay test
   collection. It consists of 2028 Malay translated Hadith documents from
   book Sahih Bukhari. This paper presents the results using Complete
   Linkage Clustering algorithm with Cosine Coefficient on Malay translated
   Hadith documents. The evaluation of the experiments uses Recall (R),
   Precision (P) and Effectiveness (E) measure. The experiments is
   conducted on 100 clusters, 50 clusters and 20 clusters. It shows that
   the smaller the size of clusters, Recall (R) will increase, but
   Precision (P) will decrease. Results for Effectiveness (E) measure
   compared to the non-clustered documents show that applying clustering
   algorithm will improved the effectiveness of searching process. For this
   experiment 20 clusters is rather effective compared to the others.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is a popular topic in data mining and information
   retrieval. Most models and methods for this problem are based on
   computing the similarity between pair documents modeled in a space of

   technique for a given corpus. In this paper, we regard these two ideas
   as clustering on term feature and on semantic feature, and have an
   assumption that they can contribute to each other in clustering. Also,
   we propose a co-training approach for spectral clustering taking two
   features into account. Experiments on four real-world datasets show the

Abstract = {{The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is a popular research
   topic in the field of text mining. In this paper, Sentiment Word
   Co-occurrence and Knowledge Pair Feature Extraction based LDA Short Text
   Clustering Algorithm (SKP-LDA) is proposed. A definition of a word bag
   based on sentiment word co-occurrence is proposed. The co-occurrence of
   emotional words takes full account of different short texts. Then, the
   short texts of a microblog are endowed with emotional polarity.
   Furthermore, the knowledge pairs of topic special words and topic
   relation words are extracted and inserted into the LDA model for
   clustering. Thus, semantic information can be found more accurately.
   Then, the hidden n topics and Top30 special words set of each topic are
   extracted from the knowledge pair set. Finally, via LDA topic model
   primary clustering, a Top30 topic special words set is obtained that is
   clustered by K-means secondary clustering. The clustering center is
   optimized iteratively. Comparing with JST, LSM, LTM and ELDA, SKP-LDA
   performs better in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure.
   The experimental results show that SKP-LDA reveals better semantic
   analysis ability and emotional topic clustering effect. It can be
   applied to the field of micro-blog to improve the accuracy of network
   public opinion analysis effectively.}},

Title = {{Opposition chaotic fitness mutation based adaptive inertia weight BPSO
   for feature selection in text clustering}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{20-34}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Due to the ever increasing number of documents in the digital form,
   automated text clustering has become a promising method for the text
   analysis in last few decades. A major issue in the text clustering is
   high dimensionality of the feature space. Most of these features are
   irrelevant, redundant, and noisy that mislead the underlying algorithm.
   Therefore, feature selection is an essential step in the text clustering
   to reduce dimensionality of the feature space and to improve accuracy of
   the underlying clustering algorithm. In this paper, a hybrid intelligent
   algorithm, which combines the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO)
   with opposition-based learning, chaotic map, fitness based dynamic
   inertia weight, and mutation, is proposed to solve feature selection
   problem in the text clustering. Here, fitness based dynamic inertia
   weight is integrated with the BPSO to control movement of the particles
   based on their current status, and the mutation and the chaotic strategy
   are applied to enhance the global search capability of the algorithm.
   Moreover, an opposition-based initialization is used to start with a set
   of promising and well-diversified solutions to achieve a better final
   solution. In addition, the opposition-based learning method is also used
   to generate opposite position of the gbest particle to get rid of the
   stagnation in the swarm. To prove effectiveness of the proposed method,
   experimental analysis is conducted on three different benchmark text
   datasets Reuters -21578, Classic4, and WebKB. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed method selects more informative features
   set compared to the competitive methods as it attains higher clustering
   accuracy. Moreover, it also improves convergence speed of the BPSO. (C)

Journal = {{TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES}},

Pages = {{3165-3179}},
Abstract = {{The vector space model (VSM) is an algebraic model that is widely used
   for data representation in text mining applications. However, the VSM
   poses a critical challenge, as it requires a high-dimensional feature
   space. Therefore, many feature selection techniques, such as employing
   roots or stems (i.e. words without infixes and prefixes, and/or
   suffixes) instead of using complete word forms, are proposed to tackle
   this space challenge problem. Recently, the literature shows that one
   more basic unit feature can be used to handle the textual features,
   which is the two-neighboring character form that we call microword. To
   evaluate this feature type, we measure the accuracy of the Arabic text
   clustering using two feature types: the complete word form and the
   microword form. Hence, the microword is two consecutive characters which
   are also known as the Bigram character feature. In the experiment, the
   principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the feature vector
   dimensions while the k-means algorithm is used for the clustering
   purposes. The testing set includes 250 documents of five categories. The
   entire corpus contains 54,472 words, whereas the vocabulary contains
   13,356 unique words. The experimental results show that the complete
   word form score accuracy is 97.2\% while the two-character form score is
   96.8\%. In conclusion, the accuracies are almost the same; however, the
   two-character form uses a smaller vocabulary as well as less PCA
   subspaces. The study experiments might be a significant indication of
   the necessity to consider the Bigram character feature in the future
   text processing and natural language processing applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new system for automated text clustering, it was
   specifically designed to work with scientific articles written in
   Brazilian Portuguese. The system has two modules, the first one extracts
   the main terms and generates an index for each text, the second module
   uses this index to group the texts within their original topics. The
   first module innovates by selecting compound terms instead of single
   terms to produce the indexes; the second module applies a new
   evolutionary clustering algorithm, having a new method of work, over the
   indexes. The system was tested with four different corpora, the metrics
   reveal a reasonable clustering result when combining compound terms and
   the evolutionary method proposed, although the number of clusters
   generated is distant from the original number of topics. The time
   consumed by the new clustering algorithm is high when running it over a
   conventional personal computer.}},

Abstract = {{With the fast development of the Internet technology, the court text
   information is collected from various fields at an unprecedented speed,
   such as Weibo and Wechat. This big court text information of high volume
   poses a vast challenge for the judge making reasonable decisions based
   on the vast cases. To cluster the reasonable assistant cases from the
   vast cases, we propose a deep CFS model for the text clustering, which
   can cluster the court text effectively, in this paper. In the proposed
   model, a robust deep text feature extractor is designed to improve the
   cluster accuracy, in which an ensemble of deep learning models are used
   to learn the deep features of the text. Furthermore, the CFS algorithm
   is conducted on the extracted deep text features, to discover the
   non-spherical clusters with the automatic find of the cluster centers.
   Finally, the proposed deep cluster model is evaluated on two typical
   datasets and the results show it can perform better than compared models
   in terms of the cluster accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Conversational systems need to understand spoken language to be able to
   converse with a human in a meaningful coherent manner. This
   understanding (Spoken Language understanding - SLU) of the human
   language is operationalized through identifying intents and entities.
   While classification methods that rely on labeled data are often used
   for SLU, creating large supervised data sets is extremely tedious and
   time consuming. This paper presents a practical approach to automate the
   process of intent discovery on unlabeled data sets of human language
   text through clustering techniques. We explore a range of
   representations for the texts and various clustering methods to validate
   the clustering stability through quantitative metrics like Adjusted
   Random Index (ARI). A final alignment of the clusters to the semantic
   intent is determined through consensus labelling. Our experiments on
   public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach generating
   homogeneous clusters with 89\% cluster accuracy, leading to better
   semantic intent alignments. Furthermore, we illustrate that the
   clustering offer an alternate and effective way to mine sentence
   variants that can aid the bootstrapping of SLU models.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional clustering algorithms do not consider the semantic
   relationships among words so that cannot accurately represent the
   meaning of documents. To overcome this problem, introducing semantic
   information from ontology such as WordNet has been widely used to
   improve the quality of text clustering. However, there still exist
   several challenges, such as synonym and polysemy, high dimensionality,
   extracting core semantics from texts, and assigning appropriate
   description for the generated clusters. In this paper, we report our
   attempt towards integrating WordNet with lexical chains to alleviate
   these problems. The proposed approach exploits ontology hierarchical
   structure and relations to provide a more accurate assessment of the
   similarity between terms for word sense disambiguation. Furthermore, we
   introduce lexical chains to extract a set of semantically related words
   from texts, which can represent the semantic content of the texts.
   Although lexical chains have been extensively used in text
   summarization, their potential impact on text clustering problem has not
   been fully investigated. Our integrated way can identify the theme of
   documents based on the disambiguated core features extracted, and in
   parallel downsize the dimensions of feature space. The experimental
   results using the proposed framework on reuters-21578 show that
   clustering performance improves significantly compared to several
   classical methods. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {{Document clustering for short texts has received considerable interest.
   Traditional document clustering approaches are designed for long
   documents and perform poorly for short texts due to the their sparseness
   representation. To better understand short texts, we observe that words
   that appear in long documents can enrich short text context and improve
   the clustering performance for short texts. In this paper, we propose a
   novel model, namely DDMAfs, which (1) improves the clustering
   performance of short texts by sharing structural knowledge of long
   documents to short texts; (2) automatically identifies the number of
   clusters; (3) separates discriminative words from irrelevant words for
   long documents to obtain high quality structural knowledge. Our
   experiments indicate that the DDMAfs model performs well on the
   synthetic dataset and real datasets. Comparisons between the DDMAfs
   model and state-of-the-art short text clustering approaches show that
   the DDMAfs model is effective.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to scientific development, a variety of challenges present in the
   field of information retrieval. These challenges are because of the
   increased usage of large volumes of data. These huge amounts of data are
   presented from large-scale distributed networks. Centralization of these
   data to carry out analysis is tricky. There exists a requirement for
   novel text document clustering algorithms, which overcomes challenges in
   clustering. The two most important challenges in clustering are
   clustering accuracy and quality. For this reason, this paper intends to
   present an ideal clustering model for text document using term
   frequency-inverse document frequency, which is considered as feature
   sets. Here, the initial centroid selection is much concentrated which
   can automatically cluster the text using weighted similarity measure in
   the proposed clustering process. In fact, the weighted similarity
   function involves the inter-cluster, and intra-cluster similarity of
   both ordered and unordered documents, which is used to minimize weighted
   similarity among the documents. An advanced model for clustering is
   proposed by the hybrid optimization algorithm, which is the combination
   of the Jaya Algorithm (JA) and Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO), and so the
   proposed algorithm is termed as JA-based GWO. Finally, the performance
   of the proposed model is verified through a comparative analysis with
   the state-of-the-art models. The performance analysis exhibits that the
   proposed model is 96.56\% better than genetic algorithm, 99.46\% better
   than particle swarm optimization, 97.09\% superior to Dragonfly
   algorithm, and 96.21\% better than JA for the similarity index.
   Therefore, the proposed model has confirmed its efficiency through
   valuable analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This research proposes an idea to apply Feature Based Clustering (FBC)
   in document clustering. A huge number of existing documents will be
   easier to be used if they are clustered into several topics. FBC uses
   K-Means algorithm to cluster sequential data of features. Features of
   text document can be presented as sequence of word. In order to be
   processed as sequential data, features must be extracted from collection
   of unstructured text documents. Therefore, we need preprocessing tasks
   to deliver appropriate form of document features. There are two types of
   sequential pattern using simple form: Frequent Word Sequence (FWS) and
   Maximal Frequent Sequence (MFS). Both types are appropriate for text
   data. The difference is in applying the maximum principle in MFS.
   Therefore, MFS amount from a text document would be less than the amount
   of its FWS. In this research, we choose maximal frequent sequences (MFS)
   as feature representation. We proposes framework to conduct FBC using
   MFS as features. The framework is tested to cluster dataset that is
   subset of the Twenty News Group Text Data. The result shows that the
   accuracy of clustering result is affected by the parameter's value,
   dataset, and the number of target cluster.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring digital devices in order to generate digital evidence related
   to an incident being investigated is essential in modern digital
   investigation. The emergence of text clustering methods plays an
   important role in developing effective digital forensics techniques.
   However, the issue of increasing the number of text sources and the
   volume of digital devices seized for analysis has been raised
   significantly over the years. Many studies indicated that this issue
   should be resolved urgently. In this paper, a comprehensive review of
   digital forensic analysis using text-clustering methods is presented,
   investigating the challenges of large volume data on digital forensic
   techniques. Moreover, a meaningful classification and comparison of the
   text clustering methods that have been frequently used for forensic
   analysis are provided. The major challenges with solutions and future
   research directions are also highlighted to open the door for
   researchers in the area of digital forensics in the age of large volume

Abstract = {{This paper presents and discusses some ensemble attribute selection
   methods for text document clustering. In this research, attributes are
   extracted in two levels. The first level document representation based
   on distribution of compact noun were constructed and relevance measure
   is applied on the distributed compact noun-document representation. it
   is used evaluate the importance of the noun. It has been widely studied
   in supervised learning, whereas it is still relatively rare researched
   in unsupervised learning. Vector Space Model has been used in many text
   mining tasks, where it has achieved good results as well as acceptable
   computational complexity. So the proposed document representations are
   exploited the nf-idf style equation. In this work, distributional nouns
   are selected into three different ways. First method, the distributed
   nouns are integrated with relevance measures, and secondly, relevance
   based distributional nouns are incorporated with Heuristic function to
   find importance of attributes. The distributional noun representations
   are used to discriminate the Nouns and measure the semantic similarity
   between documents. This proposed feature selection method have been
   successfully applied for Text clustering with flocking algorithm, HCLK

Title = {{Deep multi-view document clustering with enhanced semantic embedding}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{564}},
Pages = {{273-287}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Multi-view clustering, which aims to group data with multiple views, has
   recently attracted intense research attention. Text documents bring
   additional difficulties to multi-view clustering due to the sparseness,
   high dimensionality, and inconsistency of document views. In this paper,
   we introduced a novel model on multi-view document clustering with
   enhanced semantic embedding, namely, MDCE, to address all of the above
   difficulties of clustering text documents with more than one
   representation view. Enhanced semantic embedders are designed to learn
   and improve the semantic mapping from higher-dimensional document space
   to lower-dimensional feature space with complementary semantic
   information. Specifically, three types of complementary semantic
   information are involved in an unsupervised manner: neighbour-wise,
   view-wise, and cluster-wise complementary information. A deep network is
   designed to optimize the enhanced semantic mapping, integrate
   lower-dimensional features from multiple views, and discover document
   clustering assignments simultaneously. We conducted extensive
   experiments on our proposed MDCE model by using realistic datasets
   compared with a number of state-of-the-art multi-view clustering
   approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the MDCE-related
   models perform substantially better than all other models.

Abstract = {{Recently, MapReduce-based implementations of clustering algorithms have

Title = {{Improving spherical k-means for document clustering: Fast
   initialization, sparse centroid projection, and efficient cluster
   labeling}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Due to its simplicity and intuitive interpretability, spherical k-means
   is often used for clustering a large number of documents. However, there
   exist a number of drawbacks that need to be addressed for much effective
   document clustering. Without well-dispersed initial points, spherical
   k-means fails to converge quickly, which is critical for clustering a
   large number of documents. Furthermore, its dense centroid vectors
   needlessly incorporate the impact of infrequent and less-informative
   words, thereby distorting the distance calculation between the document
   vectors.
   In this paper, we propose practical improvements on spherical k-means to
   overcome these issues during document clustering. Our proposed
   initialization method not only guarantees dispersed initial points, but
   is also up to 1000 times faster than previously well-known
   initialization method such as k-means++. Furthermore, we enforce
   sparsity on the centroid vectors by using a data-driven threshold that
   is capable of dynamically adjusting its value depending on the clusters.
   Additionally, we propose an unsupervised cluster labeling method that
   effectively extracts meaningful keywords to describe each cluster.
   We have tested our improvements on seven different text datasets that
   include both new and publicly available datasets. Based on our
   experiments on these datasets, we have found that our proposed
   improvements successfully overcome the drawbacks of spherical k-means in
   significantly reduced computation time. Furthermore, we have
   qualitatively verified the performance of the proposed cluster labeling
   method by extracting descriptive keywords of the clusters from these
   datasets. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   provided by the workers in the form of incident reports is typically a
   rich data source and can be utilized to explore the causes and

Abstract = {{Short text clustering is a challenging problem due to its sparseness of
   text representation. Herewepropose a flexible Self-Taught Convolutional
   neural network framework for Short Text Clustering (dubbed STC2), which
   can flexibly and successfully incorporate more useful semantic features
   and learn non-biased deep text representation in an unsupervised manner.
   In our framework, the original raw text features are firstly embedded
   into compact binary codes by using one existing unsupervised
   dimensionality reduction method. Then, word embeddings are explored and
   fed into convolutional neural networks to learn deep feature
   representations, meanwhile the output units are used to fit the
   pre-trained binary codes in the training process. Finally, we get the
   optimal clusters by employing K-means to cluster the learned
   representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed framework is effective, flexible and outperform several popular
   clustering methods when tested on three public short text datasets. (C)

Abstract = {{Document clustering plays a vital role in text mining fields such as
   information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and text organizing. Document
   clustering aims to automatically divide a collection of documents based
   on some aspects of similarity into groups that are meaningful, useful or
   both. This paper aims to improve the clustering task for the Arabic
   documents. Recent studies show that partitioning clustering algorithms
   are more suitable for clustering process. However, k-means is the most
   common algorithm that is being used for clustering process because of
   its simplicity and speed. It can only generate an arbitrary solution
   because the results depend on the initial centers for the desired
   clusters ``the seeds{''}. In this paper, a new modified k-means
   algorithm called PSO K-means, supported by Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO) is applied to enhance the Arabic document clustering process.
   Then, an intensive comparative study between the proposed model and the
   standard k-means algorithm is applied. Also, the stemming algorithms
   those are being used in Arabic language processing were assessed.
   Through the experiments, an evaluation for the new algorithm is done
   with three different Arabic data sets. The results demonstrate that the
   proposed model can produce more accurate results compared to the
   standard k-means algorithm for Arabic language documents. On the other
   hand, Arabic light stemmer is more suitable for the stemming step.}},

Abstract = {{The Traditional apriori algorithm can be used for clustering the web
   documents based on the association technique of data mining. But this
   algorithm has several limitations due to repeated database scans and its
   weak association rule analysis. In modern world of large databases,
   efficiency of traditional apriori algorithm would reduce manifolds. In
   this paper, we proposed a new modified apriori approach by cutting down
   the repeated database scans and improving association analysis of
   traditional apriori algorithm to cluster the web documents. Further we
   improve those clusters by applying Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), K-Means and
   Vector Space Model (VSM) techniques separately. We use Classic3 and
   Classic4 datasets of Cornell University having more than 10,000
   documents and run both traditional apriori and our modified apriori
   approach on it. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms
   the traditional apriori algorithm in terms of database scan and
   improvement on association of analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limited labeled data, clustering is a solution for
   classifying documents that do not have prior knowledge. The combination
   of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in grouping documents by topic and
   Term Frequency-Inverse Cluster Frequency (TFxICF) in the labeling was
   proposed to resolve the problem of classification using clustering
   completed with a description of the cluster results. Indonesian text
   preprocessing has been done by the extraction of abbreviations and
   acronyms, tokenization, stemming and stopwords elimination. Experiments
   were conducted using Indonesian digital library documents, 113 documents
   from digital library of STIS and 60 documents from digital library of
   ITB, to examine the effects of text preprocessing, to compare the
   cluster results of LDA with other clustering algorithms and to compare
   the use of word and phrase tokens in the clustering and labeling. The
   cluster quality was measured by using precision, recall, and F-measure
   and the label quality was determined by similarity with the keywords
   that most frequently appear in the clusters. Based on the experimental
   results, preprocessing techniques can improve the cluster quality. LDA
   algorithm produces documents cluster by topic with cluster quality
   better than K-Means and Lingo. Word based LDA generates cluster with
   better quality than phrase based LDA. Moreover, the labeling by using
   word based TFxICF is more descriptive than phrase based TFxICF.
   Therefore, the use of word based LDA for clustering and phrase based
   TFxICF for labeling was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In Uyghur language, the words which are segmented by inter-word space as
   natural separator can hardly serve as features in text representation,
   which leads to the low efficiency of text processing, it is still a
   research topic how to use language units beyond word boundaries as
   features to represent texts and improve the efficiency of text
   processing. This paper proposes a semantic string extraction approach,
   which is a method for extracting language units beyond word boundaries.
   At the same time, it also proposes the methods for textual
   representation and similarity measurement, and verifies its
   effectiveness in Uyghur text clustering tasks. Specifically, a
   combination of string expansion and language rules are applied to
   identify the trusted frequent patterns (TFP) in the text set. Next,
   semantic strings are evaluated and selected from the text set. Regarding
   similarity measure, each text is represented as a weighted semantic
   string set, and a set-based text similarity measuring approach is
   presented. Finally, the above ideas and approaches are applied to the
   Uyghur text clustering, and the corresponding clustering algorithms are
   proposed and verified through series of experiments on the large-scale
   text corpus. Experimental results show that the semantic string-based
   text representation is in general very useful in processing Uyghur

Abstract = {{Text clustering is an important research topic in data mining. Many text
   clustering methods have been proposed and obtained satisfactory results.
   Information Bottleneck algorithm, which is based on information loss,
   can measure complicated relationship between variables. It is taken as
   one of the most informative text clustering methods and has been applied
   widely in practical. With the development of information technology, the
   scale of text becomes larger and larger. Classical information
   bottleneck based clustering method will be out of work to process
   large-scale dataset because of expensive computational cost. For dealing
   with large scale text clustering problem, a novel clustering method
   based on MapReduce is proposed. In the method, dataset is divided into
   sub datasets and deployed to different computational nodes. Each
   computational node will only process sub dataset. The computational cost
   can be reduced markedly. The efficiency of the method is illustrated
   with a practical text clustering problem.}},

Abstract = {{In micro-blog short text clustering, the amount of text information
   contained in micro-blog short text is small, with timeliness, sparseness
   and singularity, so the artificial selection of attribute words has some
   limitations. This paper puts forward the feature extraction of text
   information in micro-blog using Bootstrapping algorithm, it can choose
   the higher theme information reflect the characteristics of words, and
   then use the improved TFIDF algorithm to calculate the weight of
   micro-blog based text clustering. Finally, K-means clustering algorithm
   is used to cluster micro-blog short text. The experimental results show
   that the clustering algorithm of micro-blog short text proposed in this
   paper is better than other algorithms, which improves the clustering
   effect of micro-blog short text.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Document clustering is an important tool for text mining with its goal
   in grouping similar documents into a single cluster. As typical
   clustering methods, Concept Factorization (CF) and its variants have
   gained attention in recent studies. To improve the clustering
   performance, most of the CF methods use additional supervisory
   information to guide the clustering process. When the amount of
   supervisory information is scarce, the improved performance of CF
   methods will be limited. To overcome this limitation, this paper
   proposes a novel regularized concept factorization (RCF) algorithm with
   dual connected constraints, which focuses on whether two documents
   belong to the same class (must-connected constraint) or different
   classes (cannot-connected constraint). RCF propagates the limited
   constraint information from constrained samples to unconstrained
   samples, allowing the collection of constraint information from the
   entire data set. This information is used to construct a new data
   similarity matrix that concentrates on the local discriminative
   structure of data. The similarity matrix is incorporated as a
   regularization term in the CF objective function. By doing so, RCF is
   able to make full use of the supervisory information to preserve the
   local structure of the data set. Thus, the clustering performance will
   be improved significantly. Our experiments on standard document
   databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Automatic query expansion (AQE) is an effective measure to improve
   information retrieval performance by including additional terms in a
   user query. The pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) method employed for AQE
   so far has suffered from a major problem of query drift. Therefore,
   keeping it in view, a new hybrid document clustering for PRF based AQE
   approach is proposed in the present article. In this, Fuzzy logic and
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used to construct document
   clusters. Further, a new and effective hybrid PSO and Fuzzy logic-based
   term weighting approach is followed to find more suitable additional
   query terms using a weighted score of four IR evidences which is
   considered maximized. Moreover, a combined semantic filtering method
   along with query terms re-weighting algorithms are also used to remove
   noisy or irrelevant terms semantically. The performance of the presented
   approaches in this article is tested and compared with other approaches
   on three benchmark data sets. The comparative analysis of all the tested
   approaches illustrates the superior performance of the proposed

Abstract = {{Short text clustering is a challenging problem when adopting traditional
   bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations, since these lead to sparse
   vector representations for short texts. Low-dimensional continuous
   representations or embeddings can counter that sparseness problem: their
   high representational power is exploited in deep clustering algorithms.
   While deep clustering has been studied extensively in computer vision,
   relatively little work has focused on NLP. The method we propose, learns
   discriminative features from both an autoencoder and a sentence
   embedding, then uses assignments from a clustering algorithm as
   supervision to update weights of the encoder network. Experiments on
   three short text datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of our
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is a very important technique in the field of data
   mining. It is widely used in information retrieval and text integration.
   Most existing studies focus on the optimization of feature extraction
   methods or clustering algorithms separately. In this paper, we propose a
   neural feedback clustering algorithm combining bidirectional long
   short-term memory and convolutional neural network with kmeans method.
   Unlike previous papers, the proposed algorithm treats feature extraction
   and clustering as a united process, where clustering results can be used
   as feedback information to dynamically optimize the parameters of
   networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves
   significant improvements compared with other existing text clustering
   algorithms and has a certain degree of noise robustness.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing numbers of textual documents from diverse sources such as
   different websites (e.g. social networks, news, magazines, blogs and
   medical recommendation websites), publications and articles and medical
   prescriptions leads to massive amounts of daily complex data. This
   phenomenon has caused many researchers to focus on analysing the content
   and measuring the similarities among the documents and texts to cluster
   them. One popular method to measure the similarity between documents is
   to represent the documents as vectors and measure the similarity among
   them based on the angle or Euclidean distance between each pair. By only
   considering these two criteria for similarity measurement, we may miss
   important underlying similarities in this area. We propose a new method,
   TS-SS, to measure the similarity level among documents, in such a way
   that one hopes to better understand which documents are more (or less)
   similar. This similarity level can be used as a handy measure for
   clustering and recommendation systems for documents. It also can be used
   to show top n similar documents to a particular document or a search
   query. Our study gives insights on the drawbacks of geometrical and
   non-geometrical similarity measures and provides a novel method to
   combine the other geometric criteria into a method to measure the
   similarity level among documents from new prospective. We apply
   Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity and our new method on four
   labelled datasets. Finally we report how these three geometrical
   similarity measures perform in terms of similarity level and clustering
   purity using four evaluation techniques. The evaluations' results show
   that our new model outperforms the other measures.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Defect management is a central task in software maintenance. When a
   defect is reported, appropriate resources must be allocated to analyze
   and resolve the defect. An important issue in resource allocation is the
   estimation of Defect Resolution Time (DRT). Prior research has
   considered different approaches for DRT prediction exploiting
   information retrieval techniques and similarity in textual defect
   descriptions. In this article, we investigate the potential of text
   clustering for DRT prediction. We build on a study published by Raja
   (2013) which demonstrated that clusters of similar defect reports had
   statistically significant differences in DRT. Raja's study also
   suggested that this difference between clusters could be used for DRT
   prediction. Our aims are twofold: First, to conceptually replicate
   Raja's study and to assess the repeatability of its results in different
   settings; Second, to investigate the potential of textual clustering of
   issue reports for DRT prediction with focus on accuracy. Using different
   data sets and a different text mining tool and clustering technique, we
   first conduct an independent replication of the original study. Then we
   design a fully automated prediction method based on clustering with a
   simulated test scenario to check the accuracy of our method. The results
   of our independent replication are comparable to those of the original
   study and we confirm the initial findings regarding significant
   differences in DRT between clusters of defect reports. However, the
   simulated test scenario used to assess our prediction method yields poor
   results in terms of DRT prediction accuracy. Although our replication
   confirms the main finding from the original study, our attempt to use
   text clustering as the basis for DRT prediction did not achieve
   practically useful levels of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the linguistic features of different registers in
   Chinese through text clustering driven by the Menzerath-Altmann (MA)
   law. We propose to calculate the average word length distribution
   according to clause length. The MA law predicts that texts from
   different registers will show differences in terms of average word
   length distribution in texts. As predicted by the MA law, analysis
   result demonstrates that average word length decreases with the increase
   of clause length in each register and that their relationship can be
   fitted by the formula y = ax(b)e-cx. We hypothesize that it is the
   situation type, i.e. whether the text is dialectic or monologue, that is
   the linguistic characteristic behind the dichotomy of word length
   distribution. To confirm these register-distinguishing linguistic
   features, texts were represented by the average word length distribution
   and the fitted parameters using the vector space model and clustered
   according to their register categories. Good clustering results show
   that average word length distribution in certain length clauses and
   their fitted parameters can be used as the distinctive characteristics
   of these three registers.}},

   First, the algorithm constructs the text graph-structure according to

   The compared experimental results with hierarchical clustering algorithm

   semi-supervised clustering analysis of BOA-Argo ocean text data.
   Unsupervised K-Means and Affinity Propagation (AP) are two classical
   clustering algorithms. The Election-AP algorithm is proposed to handle
   the final cluster number in AP clustering as it has proved to be
   difficult to control in a suitable range. Semi-supervised samples
   thermocline data in the BOA-Argo dataset according to the thermocline
   standard definition, and use this data for semi-supervised cluster
   analysis. Several semi-supervised clustering algorithms were chosen for
   comparison of learning performance: Constrained-K-Means, Seeded-K-Means,
   SAP (Semi-supervised Affinity Propagation), LSAP (Loose Seed AP) and
   CSAP (Compact Seed AP). In order to adapt the single label, this paper
   improves the above algorithms to SCKM (improved Constrained-K-Means),
   SSKM (improved Seeded-K-Means), and SSAP (improved Semi-supervised
   Affinity Propagationg) to perform semi-supervised clustering analysis on
   the data. A DSAP (Double Seed AP) semi-supervised clustering algorithm
   based on compact seeds is proposed as the experimental data shows that
   DSAP has a better clustering effect. The unsupervised and

Abstract = {{A new semantic similarity method based on HowNet is proposed in this
   paper. At the level of concept, the sememes are divided into several
   classes. In this paper, the ordering of the weights of the sememe
   classes is considered. At the same time, a function is reasonably set to
   make the weights change moderately, which solves the problem of
   excessive reliance on fixed weights. Moreover, for the similarity
   between two texts, the element matching method is proposed in this
   paper. Experimental results show that the proposed method makes the text
   clustering results more accurate and reasonable compared with the
   existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a modified genetic algorithm for text document
   clustering on the cloud. Traditional approaches of genetic algorithms in
   document clustering represents chromosomes based on cluster centroids,
   and does not divide cluster centroids during crossover operations. This
   limits the possibility of the algorithm to introduce different
   variations to the population, leading it to be trapped in local minima.
   In this approach, a crossover point may be selected even at a position
   inside a cluster centroid, which allows modifying some cluster
   centroids. This also guides the algorithm to get rid of the local
   minima, and find better solutions than the traditional approaches.
   Moreover, instead of running only one genetic algorithm as done in the
   traditional approaches, this article partitions the population and runs
   a genetic algorithm on each of them. This gives an opportunity to
   simultaneously run different parts of the algorithm on different virtual
   machines in cloud environments. Experimental results also demonstrate
   that the accuracy of the proposed approach is at least 4\% higher than
   the other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering has been widely used in many Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) applications such as text summarization and news recommendation.
   However, most of the current algorithms need to predefine a clustering
   number, which is difficult to obtain. Moreover, the mutli-label
   clustering is useful in multiple clustering tasks in many applications,
   but related works are rarely available. Although several studies have
   attempted to solve above two problems, there is a need for methods that
   can solve the two issues simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a new
   text clustering algorithm called Word2Cluster. Word2Cluster can
   automatically generate an adaptive number of clusters and support
   multi-label clustering. To test the performance of Wrod2Cluster, we
   build a Chinese text dataset, Hotline, according to real world
   applications. To evaluate the clustering results better, we propose an
   improved evaluation method based on basic accuracy, precision and recall
   for multi-label text clustering. Experimental results on a Chinese text
   dataset (Hotline) and a public English text dataset (Reuters)
   demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve better F1-measure and runs
   faster than the state-of-the-art baselines.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-Non Negative Matrix Factorization (Semi-NMF) is one of the most
   popular extensions of NMF, it extends the applicable range of NMF
   models, to data having mixed signs, as well as strengthens their
   relation to clustering. However, Semi-NMF has been found to perform
   somewhat less than NMF, in terms of clustering, when applied to positive
   data such as text, which we focus on. Inspired by the recent success of
   neural word embedding models, e.g., word2vec, in learning high quality
   real valued vector representations of words, we propose to integrate a
   word embedding model into Semi-NMF. This allows Semi-NMF to capture more
   semantic relationships among words and, thereby, to infer document
   factors that are even better for clustering. The combination of Semi-NMF
   and word embedding noticeably improves the performance of NMF models, in
   terms of both clustering and embedding, as illustrated in our
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Context. In the current information era, the problem of analyzing large
   volumes of unlabeled textual data and its further grouping with respect
   to the semantic similarity between texts is emerging. This raises the
   need for robust text analysis algorithms, namely, clustering and
   extraction of key data from texts. Despite recent progress in the field
   of natural language processing, new neural methods lack interpretability
   when used for unsupervised tasks, whereas traditional distributed
   semantics and word counting techniques tend to disregard contextual
   information.
   Objective. The objective of the study is to develop an interpretable
   text clustering and cluster labeling methods with respect to the
   semantic similarity that require no additional training on the user's
   dataset.
   Method. To approach the task of text clustering, we incorporate deep
   contextualized word embeddings and analyze their evolution through
   layers of pretrained transformer models. Given word embeddings, we look
   for similar tokens across all corpus and form topics that are present in
   multiple sentences. We merge topics so that sentences that share many
   topics are assigned to one cluster. One sentence can contain a few
   topics, it can be present in more then one cluster simultaneously.
   Similarly, to generate labels for the existing cluster, we use token
   embeddings to order them based on how much they are descriptive of the
   cluster. To do so, we propose a novel metric - token rank measure and
   evaluate two other metrics.
   Results. A new unsupervised text clustering approach was described and
   implemented. It is capable of assigning a text to different clusters
   based on semantic similarity to other texts in the group. A keyword
   extraction approach was developed and applied in both text clustering
   and cluster labeling tasks. Obtained clusters are annotated and can be
   interpreted through the terms that formed the clusters.
   Conclusions. Evaluation on different datasets demonstrated
   applicability, relevance, and interpretability of the obtained results.
   The advantages and possible improvements to the proposed methods were
   described. Recommendations for using methods were provided, as well as
   possible modifications.}},

Abstract = {{The text mining of micro-blog topic information can effectively obtain
   the attention degree of internet users for news events. It is of great
   significance in the field of public opinion monitoring and analysis. At
   the situation of the algorithm of traditional frequent word set is
   suitable for long text information clustering, this paper proposes to
   mine top-K frequent corpus in short text database and then to divide
   micro-blog topic texts covering the same frequent word sets into the
   same cluster. Combined with the largest frequent word-sets for
   similarity calculation, the overlapped document is re-divided to achieve
   micro-blog short text clustering. The experimental results of micro-blog
   topic dataset and the comparison with K-means clustering algorithm show
   that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the sparseness and
   high-dimension problem of micro-blog topic short text clustering and
   greatly improve the micro-blog short text clustering effect.}},

Abstract = {{For finding the appropriate number of clusters in short text clustering,
   models based on Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) require the maximum
   possible cluster number before inferring the real number of clusters.
   However, it is difficult to choose a proper number as we do not know the
   true number of clusters in short texts beforehand. The cluster
   distribution in DMM based on Dirichlet process as prior goes down
   exponentially as the number of clusters increases. Therefore, we propose
   a novel model based on Pitman-Yor Process to capture the power-law
   phenomenon of the cluster distribution in the paper. Specifically, each
   text chooses one of the active clusters or a new cluster with
   probabilities derived from the Pitman-Yor Process Mixture model (PYPM).
   Discriminative words and nondiscriminative words are identified
   automatically to help enhance text clustering. Parameters are estimated
   efficiently by collapsed Gibbs sampling and experimental results show
   PYPM is robust and effective comparing with the state-of-the-art models.}},

Title = {{Unsupervised neural networks for automatic Arabic text summarization
   using document clustering and topic modeling}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{172}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Humans must easily handle the vast amounts of data being generated by
   the revolution of information technology. Thus, Automatic Text
   summarization has been applied to various domains in order to find the
   most relevant information and make critical decisions quickly. In the
   context of Arabic, text summarization techniques suffer from several
   problems. First, most existing methods do not consider the context or
   domain to which the document belongs. Second, the majority of the
   existing approaches are based on the traditional bag-of-words
   representation, which involves high dimensional and sparse data, and
   makes it difficult to capture relevant information. Third, research in
   Arabic Text summarization is fairly small and only recently compared to
   that on Anglo-Saxon and other languages due to the shortage of Arabic
   corpora, resources, and automatic processing tools. In this paper, we
   try to overcome these limitations by proposing a new approach using
   documents clustering, topic modeling, and unsupervised neural networks
   in order to build an efficient document representation model. First, a
   new document clustering technique using Extreme learning machine is
   performed on large text collection. Second, topic modeling is applied to
   documents collection in order to identify topics present in each
   cluster. Third, each document is represented in a topic space by a
   matrix where rows represent the document sentences and columns represent
   the cluster topics. The generated matrix is then trained using several
   unsupervised neural networks and ensemble learning algorithms in order
   to build an abstract representation of the document in the concept
   space. Important sentences are ranked and extracted according to a graph
   model with a redundancy elimination component. The proposed approach is
   evaluated on Essex Arabic Summaries Corpus and compared against other
   Arabic text summarization approaches using ROUGE measure. Experimental
   results showed that the models trained on topic representation learn
   better representations and improve significantly the summarization
   performance. In particular, ensemble learning models demonstrated an
   important improvement on Rouge recall and promising results on
   F-measure.}},

Abstract = {{The manual structural organization of documents is expensive in terms of
   time and efforts. Traversing large number of documents to interpret
   manually is also challenging issue. Therefore, sophisticated means are
   needed to cope with this challenge. Clustering is one of the automated
   solutions. It is a major tool in many applications of business and data
   sciences. Document clustering sorts out records into various gatherings
   called as groups, where the documents in each group share some regular
   properties as indicated in closeness or similarity measure. Robust
   document clustering assumes an essential role in helping its users to
   successfully explore, condense, and sort out the data. This paper aims
   at clustering textual documents using TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse
   Document Frequency) scheme. This research proposed methods for the
   selection of initial centroids in k-means clustering algorithm, which
   reduces efforts to great extent by minimizing the number of iterations
   usually one and efficiently ensures the accuracy of obtained clusters.
   Besides, the proposed methods expressed potentially promising results
   for small document sets.}},

   similarity, and modify the AHC algorithm by adopting the proposed
   similarity metric as the approach to the text clustering. The proposed
   AHC algorithm is empirically validated as the better approach in
   clustering texts in news articles and opinions. We need to define and

Abstract = {{Text clustering is a task of grouping similar documents into a cluster
   while assigning the dissimilar ones in other clusters. A well-known
   clustering method which is the K-means algorithm is extensively employed
   in many disciplines. However, there is a big challenge to determine the
   number of clusters using K-means. This paper presents a new clustering
   algorithm, termed Gravity Firefly Clustering (GF-CLUST) that utilizes
   Firefly Algorithm for dynamic document clustering. The GF-CLUST features
   the ability of identifying the appropriate number of clusters for a
   given text collection, which is a challenging problem in document
   clustering. It determines documents having strong force as centers and
   creates clusters based on cosine similarity measurement. This is
   followed by selecting potential clusters and merging small clusters to
   them. Experiments on various document datasets, such as 20Newgroups,
   Reuters-21578 and TREC collection are conducted to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed GF-CLUST. The results of purity, F-measure
   and Entropy of GF-CLUST outperform the ones produced by existing
   clustering techniques, such as K-means, Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO) and Practical General Stochastic Clustering Method (pGSCM).
   Furthermore, the number of obtained clusters in GF-CLUST is near to the
   actual number of clusters as compared to pGSCM.}},

Abstract = {{Text document clustering refers to the unsupervised classification of
   textual documents into clusters based on content similarity and can be
   applied in applications such as search optimization and extracting
   hidden information from data generated by IoT sensors. Swarm
   intelligence (SI) algorithms use stochastic and heuristic principles
   that include simple and unintelligent individuals that follow some
   simple rules to accomplish very complex tasks. By mapping features of
   problems to parameters of SI algorithms, SI algorithms can achieve
   solutions in a flexible, robust, decentralized, and self-organized
   manner. Compared to traditional clustering algorithms, these solving
   mechanisms make swarm algorithms suitable for resolving complex document
   clustering problems. However, each SI algorithm shows a different
   performance based on its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, to
   find the best performing SI algorithm in text document clustering, we
   performed a comparative study for the PSO, bat, grey wolf optimization
   (GWO), and K-means algorithms using six data sets of various sizes,
   which were created from BBC Sport news and 20 newsgroups. Based on our
   experimental results, we discuss the features of a document clustering
   problem with the nature of SI algorithms and conclude that the PSO and
   GWO SI algorithms are better than K-means, and among those algorithms,
   the PSO performs best in terms of finding the optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{Many clustering algorithms work well on small data sets of less than 200
   data objects. However, a large database may contain millions of objects,
   and clustering on such a large data set may lead to biased results. As
   data volumes and availability continue to grow, so does the need for
   large dataset analytics. Among the most commonly used clustering
   algorithms, K-means proved to be one of the most popular choices to
   provide acceptable results in a reasonable amount of time. In this
   paper, we present an improved k-means algorithm with better initial
   centroids. Also, we implement this modified algorithm on Hadoop
   platform. Experiments show that the improved k-means algorithm converges
   faster than the classic k-means and the average execution time is
   reduced compared to the traditional k-means.}},

   Change Process Analysis: A Case Study}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In modern industry, the development of complex products involves
   engineering changes that frequently require redesigning or altering the
   products or their components. In an engineering change process,
   engineering change requests (ECRs) are documents (forms) with parts
   written in natural language describing a suggested enhancement or a
   problem with a product or a component. ECRs initiate the change process
   and promote discussions within an organization to help to determine the
   impact of a change and the best possible solution. Although ECRs can
   contain important details, that is, recurring problems or examples of
   good practice repeated across a number of projects, they are often
   stored but not consulted, missing important opportunities to learn from
   previous projects. This paper explores the use of Self-Organizing Map
   (SOM) to the problem of unsupervised clustering of ECR texts. A case
   study is presented in which ECRs collected during the engineering change
   process of a railways industry are analyzed. The results show that SOM
   text clustering has a good potential to improve overall knowledge reuse
   and exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{Descriptive document clustering aims at discovering clusters of
   semantically interrelated documents together with meaningful labels to
   summarize the content of each document cluster. In this work, we propose
   a novel descriptive clustering framework, referred to as CEDL. It relies
   on the formulation and generation of 2 types of heterogeneous objects,
   which correspond to documents and candidate phrases, using multilevel
   similarity information. CEDL is composed of 5 main processing stages.
   First, it simultaneously maps the documents and candidate phrases into a
   common co-embedded space that preserves higher-order, neighbor-based
   proximities between the combined sets of documents and phrases. Then, it
   discovers an approximate cluster structure of documents in the common
   space. The third stage extracts promising topic phrases by constructing
   a discriminant model where documents along with their cluster
   memberships are used as training instances. Subsequently, the final
   cluster labels are selected from the topic phrases using a ranking
   scheme using multiple scores based on the extracted co-embedding
   information and the discriminant output. The final stage polishes the
   initial clusters to reduce noise and accommodate the multitopic nature
   of documents. The effectiveness and competitiveness of CEDL is
   demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively with experiments using
   document databases from different application fields.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection is regarded as an important task in data mining. The
   applications of machine learning eliminate irrelevantly, redundant
   features so that the learning performance is improved. A novel feature
   selection method for unsupervised text clustering, that is, binary

   application of the MVO algorithm is introduced via this method, which
   selects important text features. Then, these important features are
   tested using a k-means clustering algorithm to enhance performance and
   lessen the cost of the proposed algorithm computational time. The BMVO
   performance is examined on 6 datasets that are published including
   Classic4, Wap, tr41, tr12, 20Newsgroups, and CSTR. Based on the measures
   of the evaluation, the obtained results showed that the BMVO performance
   has outperformed the rest of the comparative algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Internet is a gigantic information resource, which is growing rapidly as
   more and more data are being added to the World Wide Web. It is now
   becoming ever harder to search useful information from the web. It has
   been also been found that HTML tags which have particular meanings could
   be used to enhance the performance of IR system. Still, the bulk of data
   on the web is speedily growing. Clustering can be used to play a key
   role in organizing such a bulky amount of documents into groups.
   However, due to restrictions in prevailing clustering techniques,
   scientists started to use meta-heuristic algorithms for the document
   clustering problem. This paper provides a brief survey of the available
   literature on a web search in which HTML tags have been used in
   information retrieval and Meta-heuristics approaches used in web

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for clustering short text documents, such
   as news headlines, social media statuses, or instant messages. Due to
   the characteristics of these documents, which are usually short and
   sparse, an appropriate technique is required to discover hidden
   knowledge. The objective of this paper is to identify the combination of
   document representation, document distance, and document clustering that
   yields the best clustering quality. Document representations are
   expanded by external knowledge sources represented by a Distributed
   Representation. To cluster documents, a K-means partitioning-based
   clustering technique is applied, where the similarities of documents are
   measured by word mover's distance. To validate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method, experiments were conducted to compare the clustering
   quality against several leading methods. The proposed method produced
   clusters of documents that resulted in higher precision, recall,
   F1-score, and adjusted Rand index for both real-world and standard data
   sets. Furthermore, manual inspection of the clustering results was
   conducted to observe the efficacy of the proposed method. The topics of
   each document cluster are undoubtedly reflected by members in the
   cluster.}},

Abstract = {{Short text clustering has great challenges due to the structural
   reasons, especially when applied to small datasets. Limited number of
   words leads to a poor-quality feature vector, low clustering accuracy,
   and failure of analysis. Although some approaches have been observed in
   the related literature, there is still no agreement on an efficient
   solution. On the other hand, the Grey system theory, which gives better
   results in numerical analyses with insufficient data, has not yet been
   applied to short text clustering. The purpose of our study is to develop
   a short text clustering model based on Grey system theory applicable to
   small datasets. In order to measure the efficiency of our method, book
   reviews labeled as negative or positive were obtained from Amazon.com
   dataset collections, and small datasets have been created. The Grey
   relational clustering as well as hierarchical and partitional algorithms
   has been applied to the small datasets separately. According to the
   results, our model has better accuracy values than the other algorithms
   in clustering of small datasets containing short text. Consequently, we
   demonstrated that the Grey relational clustering should be applied to
   short text clustering for much better results.}},

Abstract = {{Policy text contains large amount of diversified data and strictly
   conforms to standards and specifications, but the traditional text
   clustering method cannot solve the problems of high dimensionality,
   sparse features, and similar meanings, so this paper proposes a weighted
   algorithm based on the LDA-Gibbs model to improve the accuracy of policy
   text clustering. Firstly, it provides realistic basis for the
   assumptions of the LDA-Gibbs topic model and the weighted algorithm;
   secondly, it pre-processes the existing policy text simulated data,
   establishes the LDA-Gibbs model, forms a weighted algorithm, and
   generates training data to determine the number of optimal topics in the
   LDA-Gibbs model and completes the final clustering of the policy text;
   finally, by summarizing, classifying and deducing the conclusions of the
   experimental data, this paper proves the objective validity and effects
   of this method. Hopefully the overall design of this method can be
   applied in the prospective study on the formulation of new policies in
   the future, the retrospective evaluation and testing of the existing
   policies and the formation of a two-way interactive mechanism.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{155412-155423}},
Abstract = {{Network-based document clustering involves forming clusters of documents
   based on their significance and relationship strength. This approach can
   be used with various types of metadata that express the significance of
   the documents and the relationships among them. In this study, we
   defined a probabilistic network graph for fine-grained document
   clustering and developed a probabilistic generative model and
   calculation method. Furthermore, a novel neural-network-based network
   embedding learning method was devised that considers the significance of
   a document based on its rankings with external measures, such as the
   download counts of relevant files, and reflects the relationship
   strength between the documents. By considering the significance of a
   document, reputative documents of clusters can be centralized and shown
   as representative documents for tasks such as data analysis and data
   representation. During evaluation tests, the proposed ranking-based
   network-embedding method performs significantly better on various
   algorithms, such as the k-means algorithm and common word/phrase-based
   clustering methods, than the existing network embedding approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering and topic modeling are fundamental tasks in text
   mining, that can be unified to reciprocally enhance each other. In this
   paper, we present a machine learning approach to the joint modeling and
   interdependent fulfilment of both tasks. In particular, document
   clustering and topic modeling are seamlessly interrelated under an
   innovative Bayesian generative model of clusters, topics and contents in
   text corpora. Such a model assumes that text corpora result from a
   generative process, in which clusters and topics act as connected latent
   factors. Essentially, clusters are initially associated with descriptive
   and actionable topic distributions, that enforce cluster coherence. The
   individual documents are then assigned to one respective cluster and
   worded accordingly. Under the devised model, document clustering and
   topic modeling can be simultaneously performed in an interdependent
   manner simply by Bayesian reasoning. For this purpose, the mathematical
   details regarding collapsed Gibbs sampling as well as parameter
   estimation are derived and implemented into an approximate inference
   algorithm. Comparative experiments on standard benchmark text corpora
   reveal the effectiveness of our approach at jointly clustering text
   documents and unveiling their semantics in terms of coherent topics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a clustering and authorship attribution study over
   the State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2014 (224 speeches
   delivered by 41 presidents). To define the style of each presidency, we
   have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the
   part-of-speech (POS) frequencies. From Roosevelt (1934), each president
   tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend
   usually to share some stylistic aspects with others. Applying an
   automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content-bearing
   word-types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in
   forming clusters, a factor that is more important than political
   affiliation. Using the 300 most frequent word-types, we generate another
   clustering representation based on the style of each president. This
   second view shares similarities with the first one, but usually with
   more numerous and smaller clusters. Finally, an authorship attribution
   approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7\% under

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Memetic-based clustering method that
   improves the partitioning of document clustering. Our proposed method is
   named as Differential Evolution Memetic Clustering (DEMC). Differential
   Evolution (DE) is used for the selection of the best set of cluster
   centres (centroids) while the Chaotic Logistic Search (CLS) is used to
   enhance the best set of solutions found by DE. For the purpose of
   comparison, the DEMC is compared with the basic DE, Differential
   Evolution Simulated Annealing (DESA) and the Differential Evolution
   K-Means (DEKM) methods as well as the traditional partitioning
   clustering using the K-means. The DEMC is also compared with the
   recently proposed Chaotic Gradient Artificial Bee Colony (CGABC)
   document clustering method. The reuters-21578, a pair of the 20-news
   group, classic 3 and TDT benchmark collection (TDT5) along with
   real-world six-event-crimes datasets are used in the experiments in this
   paper. The results showed that the proposed DEMC outperformed the other
   methods in terms of the convergence rate measured by the fitness
   function (ADDC) and the compactness of the resulted clusters measured by
   the F-macro and F-micro measures.}},

   clustering. Yet it is prone to getting stuck at local optimums.
   Recently, cluster ensemble has shown to be an effective method in

   combining multiple clustering solutions resulted by SKM. This paper
   describes and compares three graph partitioning algorithms and four
   hierarchy clustering algorithms for document clustering, both
   theoretically and empirically, using a selective cluster ensemble
   framework,. Our experimental results over several document datasets show
   that, in terms of normalized mutual information, (a) The hierarchy
   clustering algorithms produce better clustering results than graph
   partitioning algorithms (b) on most datasets, the best results are

Abstract = {{KMeans is one of the most popular document clustering algorithms. It is
   usually initialized by random seeds that can drastically impact the
   final algorithm performance. There exists many random or order-sensitive
   methods that try to properly initialize KMeans but their problem is that
   their result is non-deterministic and unrepeatable. Thus KMeans needs to
   be initialized several times to get a better result, which is a
   time-consuming operation. In this paper, we introduce a novel
   deterministic seeding method for KMeans that is specifically designed
   for text document clustering. Due to its simplicity, it is fast and can
   be scaled to large datasets. Experimental results on several real-world
   datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has overall better
   performance compared to several deterministic, random, or
   order-sensitive methods in terms of clustering quality and runtime.}},

Abstract = {{Short text clustering is an increasingly important methodology but faces
   the challenges of sparsity and high-dimensionality of text data.
   Previous concept decomposition methods have obtained concept vectors via
   the centroids of clusters using k-means-type clustering algorithms on
   normal, full texts. In this study, we propose a new concept
   decomposition method that creates concept vectors by identifying
   semantic word communities from a weighted word co-occurrence network
   extracted from a short text corpus or a subset thereof. The cluster
   memberships of short texts are then estimated by mapping the original
   short texts to the learned semantic concept vectors. The proposed method
   is not only robust to the sparsity of short text corpora but also
   overcomes the curse of dimensionality, scaling to a large number of
   short text inputs due to the concept vectors being obtained from
   term-term instead of document-term space. Experimental tests have shown
   that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. (C)

Abstract = {{In modern industry, the development of complex products involves
   engineering changes that frequently require redesigning or altering the
   products or their components. In an Engineering Change process,
   Engineering Change Requests (ECRs) are natural language written texts
   exchanged among process operators. ECRs describe the required change on
   a product or a component and the solution. After the change
   implementation, ECRs are stored but never consulted, missing
   opportunities to learn from previous projects. This paper explores the
   application of text clustering to natural language texts written during
   the Engineering Change process in industry. In detail, the use of Self
   Organizing Map (SOM) to the problem of unsupervised clustering of ECR
   texts is explored. A case study is presented in which ECRs collected
   during the Engineering Change process of a railways industry are
   analysed. The results show that SOM text clustering has a good potential

   proposes a new method based on Bilingual Semantic Cor-respondence
   Analysis (BiSCAN). In the new method, a bilingual document-pair are
   looked as two views for the same semantic content and a single topic
   space is created for each language by using partial least squares (PLS)
   method in order to capture statistical dependencies of bilingual
   semantic correspondence. The topic spaces are merged for document
   clustering task. Experimental results on Chinese-English stories

Abstract = {{Clustering through organizing large text corpora has a key role in an
   easy navigation and browsing of massive amounts of text data and in
   particular in search engines. The documents comparison using the
   conventional clustering techniques is based on the surface similarities
   of words or extracted morphemes. This leads to non-semantic clusters
   usually. In this paper, Farsi, also known as Persian, has been taken
   into account with regards to the fact that the amount of electronic
   Farsi texts are growing rapidly. The documents are enriched by using
   semantic relationships - synonymy, hypernymy and hyponymy-extracted from
   FarsNet lexical ontology. A WSD procedure is proposed to decrease
   uncertainty. After preprocessing routines, three clustering algorithms

Abstract = {{Soft and hard clustering efficiency evaluation of novel approach of
   frequent pattern growth based fuzzy particle swarm optimization for
   clustering web documents is studied and analyzed in this paper. The
   conventional approaches K-Means and Fuzzy c-means (FCM) fails with
   regard to random initialization and local minima hookups. To overcome
   this drawbacks, bio inspired mechanisms like genetic algorithm, ant
   colony optimization and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to
   optimize the K-means and FCM clustering. The major contribution of the
   novel method are three fold. Primarily in its ways to automatically find
   effective cluster numbers, cluster centroids and swarms for the bio
   inspired fuzzy particle swarm optimization. Second in yielding fuzzy
   overlapping clusters using the FCM objective function overcoming the
   drawbacks of the existing methods. Third, the methodology discusses in
   this paper prunes out the irrelevant elements from the search space and
   thereby retains all relationships with search query as semantic
   conditionally relatable sets. The evaluation results show that our
   proposed approach performs better for Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
   Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted Concordance Index (ACI)
   against various distance based similarity measures and FCMPSO.}},

Abstract = {{The question answering system plays an important role in information
   retrieval field, where the user is in need of getting a precise answer
   instead of large collections of documents. The aim of this paper is to
   investigate techniques for improving sentence-based question answering
   system. To achieve this, a POS-Tagger-based question pattern analysis
   model is proposed to identify question type based on pattern template
   for the user-submitted query. Next, the knowledge base is created from a
   large corpus by clustering the documents by grouping on domain context.
   The proposed semantic-word-based answer generator model deals with the
   user query mapping with an appropriate sentence in the knowledge base.
   By the proposed models, the system reduces the search gap among user
   queries and answer sentences using Wordnet. It considers word order,
   overlap, sentence similarity, string distance, unambiguous words and
   semantic similarity of words. The proposed algorithm evaluates with
   benchmark datasets such as 20Newsgroup and TREC-9 QA, and proves its
   efficiency by statistical test for significance.}},

   that the proposed generalization scheme produces a superior cluster
   hierarchy when compared with two existing generalization techniques in
   terms of the precision, recall, f-measure, and the rand index. The
   generalization scheme is well-equipped to deal with large datasets and
   the speed-up achieved by the parallelized generalization scheme over its

Abstract = {{This paper considers volume minimization (VolMin)-based structured
   matrix factorization. VolMin is a factorization criterion that
   decomposes a given data matrix into a basis matrix times a structured
   coefficient matrix via finding the minimum-volume simplex that encloses
   all the columns of the data matrix. Recent work showed that VolMin
   guarantees the identifiability of the factor matrices under mild
   conditions that are realistic in a wide variety of applications. This
   paper focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of VolMin. On
   the theory side, exact equivalence of two independently developed
   sufficient conditions for VolMin identifiability is proven here, thereby
   providing a more comprehensive understanding of this aspect of VolMin.
   On the algorithm side, computational complexity and sensitivity to
   outliers are two key challenges associated with real-world applications
   of VolMin. These are addressed here via a new VolMin algorithm that
   handles volume regularization in a computationally simple way, and
   automatically detects and iteratively downweights outliers,
   simultaneously. Simulations and real-data experiments using a remotely
   sensed hyperspectral image and the Reuters document corpus are employed
   to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Title = {{A modified bond energy algorithm with fuzzy merging and its application
   to Arabic text document clustering}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{159}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Conventional textual documents clustering algorithms suffer from several
   shortcomings, such as the slow convergence of the immense
   high-dimensional data, the sensitivity to the initial value, and the
   understandability of the description of the resulted clusters. Although
   many clustering algorithms have been developed for English and other
   languages, very few have tackled the problem of clustering the
   under-resourced Arabic language. In this work, we propose a modified
   version of the Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA) combined with a fuzzy merging
   technique to solve the problem of Arabic text document clustering. The
   proposed algorithm, Clustering Arabic Documents based on Bond Energy,
   hereafter named CADBE, attempts to identify and display natural variable
   clusters within huge sized data. CADBE has three steps to cluster Arabic
   documents: the first step instantiates a cluster affinity matrix using
   the BEA, the second step uses a new and novel method to partition the
   cluster matrix automatically into small coherent clusters, and the last
   step uses a fuzzy merging technique to merge similar clusters based on
   the associations and interrelations between the resulted clusters.
   Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm effectively
   outperformed the conventional clustering algorithms such as
   Expectation-Maximizati on (EM), Single Linkage, and UPGMA in terms of
   clustering purity and entropy. It also outperformed kmeans, k-means++,
   spherical k-means, and CoclusMod in most test cases. However, there are
   several merits of CADBE. First, unlike the traditional clustering
   algorithms, it does not require to specify the number of clusters. In
   addition, it produces clusters with distinct boundaries, which makes its
   results more objective, and finally it is deterministic, such that it is
   insensitive to the order in which documents are presented to the
   algorithm. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The high feature space (dimension) is one of the main issues to be
   considered in the text clustering process. Therefore, various
   dimensional reduction methods have been introduced for selecting
   informative sub feature. Each method uses a different strategy to select
   sub feature, and the results are different even if using the same data
   set. Typically, union methods and intersection methods are used to
   combine selected sub feature with different reduction methods. The union
   method selects all feature and intersection only selects the general
   feature under consideration. Thus, the union approach causes an increase
   in feature dimensions and the intersection approach causes the loss of
   some important feature. Therefore, in order to take advantage of a
   method and reduce its weaknesses, this research proposes new approach,
   which are called modified union. This approach applies the union methods
   to select top ranking feature and applies intersection methods to the
   rest of the feature. In this case, feature selection uses the Term
   Variance (TV) and Document Frequency (DF) methods to calculate the
   relevance value of each feature. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is tested on the data set of Hadith Shahih Bukhary. The results
   show that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy over other
   methods with DB index is 2.7.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is the partitioning of a given collection of
   documents into various K- groups based on some similarity/dissimilarity
   criterion. This task has applications in scope detection of
   journals/conferences, development of some automated peer-review support
   systems, topic-modeling, latest cognitive-inspired works on text
   summarization, and classification of documents based on semantics, etc.
   In the current paper, a cognitive-inspired multi-objective automatic
   document clustering technique is proposed which is a fusion of
   self-organizing map (SOM) and multi-objective differential evolution
   approach. The variable number of cluster centers are encoded in
   different solutions of the population to determine the number of
   clusters from a data set in an automated way. These solutions undergo
   various genetic operations during evolution. The concept of SOM is
   utilized in designing new genetic operators for the proposed clustering
   technique. In order to measure the goodness of a clustering solution,
   two cluster validity indices, Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik index, and
   Silhouette index, are optimized simultaneously. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach, namely self-organizing map based multi-objective
   document clustering technique (SMODoc\_clust) is shown in automatic
   classification of some scientific articles and web-documents. Different
   representation schemas including tf, tf-idf and word-embedding are
   employed to convert articles in vector-forms. Comparative results with
   respect to internal cluster validity indices, namely, Dunn index and
   Davies-Bouldin index, are shown against several state-of-the-art
   clustering techniques including three multi-objective clustering
   techniques namely MOCK, VAMOSA, NSGA-II-Clust, single objective genetic
   algorithm (SOGA) based clustering technique, K-means, and single-linkage
   clustering. Results obtained clearly show that our approach is better
   than existing approaches. The validation of the obtained results is also
   shown using statistical significant t tests.}},

Abstract = {{Topic detection and tracking (TDT) under modern media circumstances has
   been dramatically innovated with the ever-changing social network and
   inconspicuous connections among participants in the internet
   communities. Apart from the inherent word features of analysing
   materials, such as news articles and personal or professional comments,
   incidental information attracts increasing attention from the research
   community. Meanwhile, numerous interrelations hiding in the propagated
   articles and network participants also promote the transfer and
   evolvement of topics, not only apparent connections, for example having
   the same tags and belonging to the same party, but also weak connections
   which are complicated and with little causal relations. Therefore,
   answering the question how to exploit and use this hidden information in
   the social network will extend the landscape of research on TDT. In this
   paper, we employ the followers' groups extracted from Twitter as the
   social context that accompanied the corresponding news articles and
   explore the interior links among them to develop a non-negative
   factorization methods with semi-supervised information derived from the
   original data. Furthermore, experiments are conducted on real and
   semi-synthetic data sets to test the performance of topic detection and
   documents clustering. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
   outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Accessibility is a critical aspect to be considered by college library
   in order to facilitate users in searching library collections. The
   Library of Universitas Indonesia, as one of Asia's largest library with
   more than 1,500,000 book collections, should also concern about
   accessibility to balance its numerous collections. UI-ana collections or
   works produced by and associated with Universitas Indonesia; in
   particular theses (undergraduate and graduate theses) and dissertations
   are one of the largest numbers of collections in Universitas Indonesia's
   Library. However, the current collection's management system was still
   based on the submission of the collection in Universitas Indonesia's
   Library. Since these collections are arranged with no exact criterion,
   it is harder for users to find theses and dissertations with the same
   topic. Therefore, management of these collections based on certain
   criterion is extremely needed to facilitate users in searching these
   collections. This research aims to determine the categories that can
   represent theses and dissertations through abstract text mining of each
   collection in 2005-2015 with a clustering algorithm, namely
   Self-organizing Map. This study found 139 categories which will be used

Abstract = {{Nowadays, a number of short messages or short text contents created on
   the Internet are rapidly increasing. Tasks to manipulate, analyze, and
   extract knowledge from them lead mining techniques such as text
   clustering to become more important. However, applying traditional text
   clustering algorithms which consider only common words or phrases to
   group short texts is inefficient due to the problem of sparsity. In this
   paper, we propose a new clustering technique, called word semantic graph
   clustering, based on the use of text concepts. We apply the word
   embedding model from Word2Vec to capture the semantic meaning of words
   and later construct semantic subgraphs in which those words represented
   as vertices are connected by some high semantic similarities. Finally,
   short text documents will be assigned to the same cluster if they
   contain at least one word belonging to the same semantic subgraph.
   Experimental results conducted on two real datasets show that the
   proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art text clustering
   algorithms. In addition, it can also produce more appropriate label for
   each cluster than the comparative algorithms do.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to cluster the injury narratives to extract
   the root causes behind the accidents. Analysis is done on incident data
   collected from the database of an integrated steel plant. Key terms
   generated from the clustering of incident scenario help us in finding
   root causes of that particular incident. This study also proposed
   specific measures to the management that would improve the safety
   performance. This study uses text document clustering to discover the
   hidden factors and causes behind the incidents. Understanding previous
   accidents is necessary to avoid future accidents. However, for
   companies, management of large accident databases, and accurately
   classifying accident narratives are very challenging issues. Therefore,
   the aim of this study is to accurately classify accident reports using
   text classification approaches and evaluate their usefulness. The study
   used two machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely random forest (RF),
   and support vector machine (SVM) and found that SVM performed best in
   classifying the accident narratives. Further, SVM was experimented with
   different tokenization of the preprocessed narratives to get more
   reliable results.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for document clustering and topic modelling in online social
   networks (OSNs) offer a means of categorising, annotating and making
   sense of large volumes of user generated content. Many techniques have
   been developed over the years, ranging from text mining and clustering
   methods to latent topic models and neural embedding approaches. However,
   many of these methods deliver poor results when applied to OSN data as
   such text is notoriously short and noisy, and often results are not
   comparable across studies. In this study we evaluate several techniques
   for document clustering and topic modelling on three datasets from
   Twitter and Reddit. We benchmark four different feature representations
   derived from term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) matrices
   and word embedding models combined with four clustering methods, and we
   include a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model for comparison.
   Several different evaluation measures are used in the literature, so we
   provide a discussion and recommendation for the most appropriate
   extrinsic measures for this task. We also demonstrate the performance of
   the methods over data sets with different document lengths. Our results
   show that clustering techniques applied to neural embedding feature
   representations delivered the best performance over all data sets using
   appropriate extrinsic evaluation measures. We also demonstrate a method
   for interpreting the clusters with a top-words based approach using
   tf-idf weights combined with embedding distance measures.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic information such as online newspapers, journals, conference
   proceedings, Web sites, e-mails, etc. They are-growing very fast in
   extremely large amount. Using all this electronic information
   controlling, indexing or searching is not possible for human and for
   search engines also for such a huge amount of large data. Therefore,
   automatic document organization become a critical issue. With the help
   of document clustering methods, we can understand data distribution or
   we can preprocess data for other applications. For an instance, Search
   engine can produce results more effectively and efficiently if a search
   engine uses documents those are clustered to search an item or data.
   Document clustering is an automatic clustering operation and also it is
   a technique of an unsupervised learning. It combines related documents
   in one cluster and unrelated documents in different clusters so each
   cluster consist of documents that are related to one another within the
   same clusters and are unrelated to documents belonging to other cluster.
   For applying any clustering methods, it is necessary to calculate
   similarity measure. The similarity measure is used to find out the
   degree of closeness or degree of similarity of the target objects. In
   this paper, we introduce document clustering on Multiview point-based
   similarity measure and two related document clustering methods. The
   existing document clustering dissimilarity/similarity measure uses only
   a single viewpoint, which is the origin that means it uses only one
   reference point, while the ours use many different viewpoints of
   references.}},

   Algorithm for Microblog Hot Topic Discovery}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{32215-32225}},
Abstract = {{Microblog hot topic discovery is one of the research hotspots in the
   field of text mining. The distance function of traditional K-means leads
   to low clustering accuracy, which leads to poor hot topic discovery.
   Three definitions are proposed in this paper: title words and body
   words, positional contribution-based weight and fusion similarity-based
   distance. The short text clustering algorithm based on BTM and GloVe
   similarity linear fusion (BG \& x0026; SLF-Kmeans) is further proposed.
   BTM and GloVe are used to model the preprocessed microblog short texts.
   JS divergence is adopted to calculate the text similarity based on BTM
   topic modeling. WMD of improved word weight (IWMD) is used to calculate
   the text similarity based on GloVe word vector modeling. Finally, the
   two similarities are linearly fused and used as the distance function to
   realize K-means clustering. Specific word sets of 6 hot topics can be
   obtained, and microblog hot topics can be discovered. The experimental
   results show that BG \& x0026; SLF-Kmeans significantly improves
   clustering accuracy compared with TF-IDF \& x0026; K-means, BTM \&
   x0026; K-means, and BTF \& x0026; SLF-Kmeans.}},

   and upper approximation of a set can be used for document clustering,
   has been presented. Rough set clusters are shown to be useful for
   representing real-time applications such as biomedical inferences,
   network data handling, and citation analysis. The survey is done in
   phases, showing how machine learning algorithms have been incorporated
   for document clustering using rough set theory, as well as how rough set
   theory has been extended to adapt to document clustering with feature
   selection techniques and feature/dimensionality reduction and, finally,
   ending with a view of assorted clustering tasks where rough set theory
   is applied. The classification of rough set theory for document
   clustering is depicted and its applications presented in this paper. The
   rough set theory works with resolving ambiguity and uncertainty in data.
   To the best of our knowledge, a rough set clustering survey has not been
   done earlier in the literature reviewed and the survey ends with a
   critical analysis of rough set theory in each application of clustering.}},

Abstract = {{K-Means algorithm has a major shortcoming of high dimensional and sparse
   data. So the traditional measurement of the distance can't deal with the
   data effectively. Motivated by this, this paper proposed a K-Means
   algorithm based on SimHash. After preprocessing of the text, SimHash is
   used to calculate the feature vectors extracted, and then the
   fingerprint of each text is obtained. SimHash not only reduces the
   dimension of the text, but also directly calculates the Hamming distance
   between the fingerprints as the vector distance. According to the
   Hamming distance, it can judge which clustering the data is belongs to.
   Experimental result shows that the algorithm guarantees the quality of
   the clustering, and greatly reduces the speed of K-means clustering
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Scalable big data analysis frameworks are of paramount importance in the
   modern web society, which is characterized by a huge number of
   resources, including electronic text documents. Document clustering is
   an important field in text mining and is commonly used for document
   organization, browsing, summarization and classification. Hierarchical
   clustering methods construct a hierarchy structure that, combined with
   the produced clusters, can be useful in managing documents, thus making
   the browsing and navigation process easier and quicker, and providing
   only relevant information to the users' queries by leveraging the
   structure relationships. Nevertheless, the high computational cost and
   memory usage of baseline hierarchical clustering algorithms render them
   inappropriate for the vast number of documents that must be handled
   daily. In this paper, we propose a new scalable hierarchical clustering
   framework, which uses the frequency of the topics in the documents to
   overcome these limitations. Our work consists of a binary tree
   construction algorithm that creates a hierarchy of the documents using
   three metrics (Identity, Entropy, Bin Similarity), and a branch breaking
   algorithm which composes the final clusters by applying thresholds to
   each branch of the tree. The clustering algorithm is followed by a
   meta-clustering module which makes use of graph theory to obtain
   insights in the leaf clusters' connections. The feature vectors
   representing each document derive from topic modeling. At the
   implementation level, the clustering method has been dockerized in order
   to facilitate its deployment on cloud computing infrastructures.
   Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated on several datasets of
   varying size and content, achieving significant reduction in both memory
   consumption and computational time over existing hierarchical clustering
   algorithms. The experiments also include performance testing on cloud
   resources using different setups and the results are promising.}},

Abstract = {{Unsupervised learning of text documents is an essential and significant
   process of knowledge discovery and data mining. The concept, context and
   semantic relevancy are the important and exclusive factors in text
   mining, where as in the case of unsupervised learning of record
   structured data, these factors are not in scope. The current majority of
   benchmarking document clustering models is keen and relies on term
   frequency, and all these models are not considering the concept, context
   and semantic relations during document clustering. In regard to this,
   our earlier work introduced a novel document clustering approach that
   named as Document Clustering by Conceptual Relevance (DCCR), which is
   aimed at concept relevancy. With the lessons learned from the empirical
   study of the DCCR, here we presented a novel document clustering
   approach, which is based on concept and semantic relevancy of the
   documents. The significant contribution of this proposal is feature
   formation by concept and semantic relevance. An unsupervised learning
   approach that estimates similarity between any two documents by concept
   and semantic relevance score is proposed. This novel method represents
   the concept as correlation between arguments and activities in given
   documents, and the semantic relevance is assessed by estimating the
   similarity between documents through the hyponyms of the arguments. The
   experiments was conducted to assess the significance of the proposed
   model and in regard to this, the benchmark datasets were used.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies for live presentations should consider users' capabilities
   to manage large amounts of data in real-time, particularly, exchanges of
   short texts (e.g., phrases). This study examines the effects on time and
   quality of text clustering algorithms applied to short, medium, and long
   size texts, and examines whether short text clustering shows a
   reasonable performance for live presentations. We run several
   simulations in which we varied the number of phrases (from 5 to 200)
   contained in each text type (long, medium, and short) and the number of
   generated clusters (from 2 to 10). The algorithms used were snowball
   steamers, TF-IDF, and K-means for clustering; and the text types were
   Reuters, 20 NewsGroup and an experimental data set, for the long,
   medium, and short size texts, respectively. The first result showed that
   text size had a large effect on the algorithms execution time, with the
   shortest average time for the short texts and longer average time for
   the longest texts. The second result showed that the number of phrases
   in each text type significantly predicts execution time but not the
   number of clusters generated by K-means. Inertia and purity measures
   were used to test the quality of the clusters generated. Text size,
   number of phrases and number of clusters predict inertia; showing the
   lowest inertia for the short texts. Purity measures were like previously
   reported results for all text types. Thus, clustering algorithms for
   short texts can confidently be used in real-time presentations.}},

Abstract = {{Data clustering is one of the most popular techniques of information
   management, which is used in many applications of science and
   engineering such as machine learning, pattern reorganization, image
   processing, data mining, and web mining. Different algorithms have been
   suggested by researchers, where the evolutionary algorithms are the best

   that GSA-KM, which is a combination of the gravitational search
   algorithm (GSA) and K-means (KM), is superior over some other
   comparative evolutionary methods. One of the drawbacks of this approach
   is dependency on the initial seeds. In this paper, a combination method
   of GSA and K-harmonic means, called GSA-KHM, has been proposed, in which
   the dependency on the initialization has been improved. The proposed
   GSA-KHM method has been applied to data clustering. As a special
   application, it has also been used on the text document clustering
   application. The simulation results show that the proposed method works

Abstract = {{Growing volumes of text and increasing expectations on the complexity of
   analysis entail advanced approaches to text mining. Unsupervised text
   clustering is an efficient approach to determine structural groupings in
   a text corpus without the impact of external bias. The information
   content of such structural groupings needs to be enhanced by integrating
   semantics into the cluster outcomes. This integration can eventuate at
   different stages of the clustering process where semantic relatedness
   measures can be used for the integration. In this paper we propose a
   novel method of semantics integration to cluster separation in a dynamic
   self-organizing map algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method and the value of semantics integration for cluster
   separation with empirical results from two benchmark text datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is an important unsupervised data analysis technique, which
   divides data objects into clusters based on similarity. Clustering has
   been studied and applied in many different fields, including pattern
   recognition, data mining, decision science and statistics. Clustering
   algorithms can be mainly classified as hierarchical and partitional
   clustering approaches. Partitioning around medoids (PAM) is a
   partitional clustering algorithms, which is less sensitive to outliers,
   but greatly affected by the poor initialization of medoids. In this
   paper, we augment the randomized seeding technique to overcome problem
   of poor initialization of medoids in PAM algorithm. The proposed
   approach (PAM++) is compared with other partitional clustering
   algorithms, such as K-means and K-means++ on text document clustering
   benchmarks and evaluated in terms of F- measure. The results for
   experiments indicate that the randomized seeding can improve the
   performance of PAM algorithm on text document clustering.}},

Abstract = {{As an important teaching tool of visualization, the concept map has
   become a hot spot in the field of smart education. The traditional
   concept map generation algorithm is hard to guarantee the construction
   process and quality because of the huge amount of work and the great
   influence of the expert experience. A TC-ARM algorithm for automatic
   generation of hybrid concept map based on text clustering and
   association rules mining is proposed. This algorithm takes full account
   of the attributes of the relationship between concepts, uses text
   clustering technology to replace the relationship between artificial
   mining concepts and test questions, combines association rules mining
   methods to generate the concept maps, and introduces consistency of
   answer record parameter to improve the efficiency of concept map
   generation. The experimental results show that the TC-ARM algorithm can
   automatically and rapidly construct the concept map, which not only
   reduces the impact of outside experts, but also dynamically adjusts the
   concept map based on the basic data. The concept map generated by the
   TC-ARM algorithm expresses the relationship between the concepts and the
   degree of closeness through the relationship pairs and relationship
   strength, and can clearly show the structural relationship between
   concepts, provide instructional optimization guidance for knowledge
   visualization.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is a promising global
   optimization algorithm inspired by concepts of quantum mechanics and
   particle swarm optimization (PSO). Since the particles are initialized
   randomly in QPSO, the blindness of initializing particles affects its
   capacity for complicated optimization. In this paper, we make full use
   of a hybrid evolutionary computation approach to resolve such an issue.
   In specific, the robust global search ability of genetic algorithm (GA)
   improves the initial strategy of particles in QPSO. What is more, the
   original position update approach of QPSO without the restriction of its
   upper bound may generate some abrupt features and cause the issue of
   overstepping boundary, which affects its performance for search of
   optimum. In this study, a new position update approach is tested to
   normalize the search range of particles in a proper space. Such an
   approach enhances its probability to find the optimal solution. Since
   the clustering problem can be regarded as the centers searching process
   by using evolutionary optimization approach, the evolutionary process of
   chromosomes or particles encoded by centers simulates the process of
   solving clustering problem. In order to testify the clustering
   performance of our approach, we conduct the experiments on 4 subsets of
   standard Reuter-21578 and 20Newsgroup datasets. Experimental results
   show that our method performs better than the state of art clustering
   algorithms in the light of the evaluations of fitness and F-measure. (C)

Abstract = {{The text clustering technique is an appropriate method used to partition
   a huge amount of text documents into groups. The documents size affects
   the text clustering by decreasing its performance. Subsequently, text
   documents contain sparse and uninformative features, which reduce the
   performance of the underlying text clustering algorithm and increase the
   computational time. Feature selection is a fundamental unsupervised
   learning technique used to select a new subset of informative text
   features to improve the performance of the text clustering and reduce
   the computational time. This paper proposes a hybrid of particle swarm
   optimization algorithm with genetic operators for the feature selection
   problem. The k-means clustering is used to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the obtained features subsets. The experiments were conducted using
   eight common text datasets with variant characteristics. The results
   show that the proposed algorithm hybrid algorithm (H-FSPSOTC) improved
   the performance of the clustering algorithm by generating a new subset
   of more informative features. The proposed algorithm is compared with
   the other comparative algorithms published in the literature. Finally,
   the feature selection technique encourages the clustering algorithm to

Title = {{Multi-view document clustering based on geometrical similarity
   measurement}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS}},
Abstract = {{Numerous works implemented multi-view clustering algorithms in document
   clustering. A challenging problem in document clustering is the
   similarity metric. Existing multi-view document clustering methods
   broadly utilized two measurements: the Cosine similarity (CS) and the
   Euclidean distance (ED). The first did not consider the magnitude
   difference (MD) between the two vectors. The second can't register the
   divergence of two vectors that offer a similar ED. In this paper, we
   originally created five models of similarity metric. This methodology
   foils the downside of the CS and ED similarity metrics by figuring the
   divergence between documents with the same ED while thinking about their
   sizes. Furthermore, we proposed our multi-view document clustering plan
   which dependent on the proposed similarity metric. Firstly, CS, ED,
   triangle's area similarity and sector's area similarity metric, and our
   five similarity metrics have been applied to every view of a dataset to
   generate a corresponding similarity matrix. Afterward, we ran clustering
   algorithms on these similarity matrices to evaluate the performance of
   single view. Later, we aggregated these similarity matrices to obtain a
   unified similarity matrix and apply spectral clustering algorithm on it
   to generate the final clusters. The experimental results show that the
   proposed similarity functions can gauge the similitude between documents
   more accurately than the existing metrics, and the proposed clustering
   scheme surpasses considerably up-to-date algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering network is defined as a group of documents which are
   associated by links. Document networks become ever-present nowadays due
   to the well-known use of online databases, as academic search engines.
   Topic modeling has developed tool used for document managing due to its
   betterquality performance. However, there are few topic models
   characteristic the significance of documents on dissimilar topics. In
   this project, we can implement text rank algorithms of documents to
   develop topic modeling and suggest to include link based ranking into
   topic modeling. Text summarization plays a fundamental role in
   information reclamation. Snippets generate by web search engines for
   each question mark result is an appliance of content summarization.
   Existing text summarization technique shows that the indexing is
   completed on the base of the words in the document and consists of an
   array of the relocation lists. Document features similar to word
   frequency, text length are used to allot indexing mass to words.
   Specifically, topical grade is used to calculate the topic level ranking
   of documents, which indicates the meaning of documents on different
   topics. By receding the topical ranking of a document as the possibility
   of the document concerned in matching topic, a isolated relation is
   built between ranking and topic modeling. Semantic clustering aim to
   group semantically related tokens recent in a document. identify
   semantically associated words for a exacting token is agreed out by
   looking the nearby tokens and discovery the equal words within a
   permanent context window. Extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs) is
   a not easy and familiar task, aimed at identify lexical substance with
   characteristic interpretation that can be festering into single words.
   We present semantic clustering based come up to automatic extraction of
   multiword expressions (MWEs). The method combine statistical information
   from a general-purpose quantity and texts starting document datasets. We
   integrate organization measures via dimension of data points to cluster
   MWEs and then divide the ranking score for each MWE based on the text
   ranks assigned to a cluster. Experimental result can be prepared on
   English linked documents and get the performance of the system in
   provisions of correctness and error rates.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of information overload, text clustering plays an important
   part in the analysis processing pipeline. Partitioning high-quality
   texts into unseen categories tremendously helps applications in
   information retrieval, databases, and business intelligence domains.
   Short texts from social media environment such as tweets, however,
   remain difficult to interpret due to the broad aspects of contexts.
   Traditional text similarity approaches only rely on the lexical matching
   while ignoring the semantic meaning of words. Recent advances in
   distributional semantic space have opened an alternative approach in
   utilizing high-quality word embeddings to aid the interpretation of text
   semantics. In this paper, we investigate the word mover's distance
   metrics to automatically cluster short text using the word semantic
   information. We utilize the agglomerative strategy as the clustering
   method to efficiently group texts based on their similarity. The
   experiment indicates the word mover's distance outperformed other
   standard metrics in the short text clustering task.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering has many applications in various areas. Before being
   clustered, texts often have already been grouped or partially grouped in
   practise. Texts from the same group are related to each other and
   concentrate on a few topics. The group information turns out to be
   valuable for text clustering. In this paper, we propose a model called
   Non-parametric Gaussian Mixture Experts to get better clustering result
   through utilizing group information. After converting texts to vectors
   by semantic embedding, our model can automatically infer proper cluster
   number for every group and the whole corpus. We develop an online

   The results demonstrate our model has significantly better performance

Abstract = {{Text mining refers to the process of extracting the high-quality
   information from the text. It is broadly used in applications, like text
   clustering, text categorization, text classification, etc. Recently, the
   text clustering becomes the facilitating and challenging task used to
   group the text document. Due to some irrelevant terms and large
   dimension, the accuracy of text clustering is reduced. In this paper,
   the semantic word processing and novel Particle Grey Wolf Optimizer
   (PGWO) is proposed for automatic text clustering. Initially, the text
   documents are given as input to the pre-processing step which caters the
   useful keyword for feature extraction and clustering. Then, the
   resultant keyword is applied to wordnet ontology to find out the
   synonyms and hyponyms of every keyword. Subsequently, the frequency is
   determined for every keyword which is used to build the text feature
   library. Since the text feature library contains the larger dimension,
   the entropy is utilized to select the most significant feature. Finally,
   the new algorithm Particle Grey Wolf Optimizer (PGWO) is developed by
   integrating the particle swarm optimization (PSO) into the grey wolf
   optimizer (GWO). Thus, the proposed algorithm is used to assign the
   class labels to generate the different clusters of text documents. The
   simulation is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed
   algorithm,and the proposed algorithm is compared with existing
   algorithms. The proposed method attains the clustering accuracy of
   80.36\% for 20 Newsgroup dataset and the clustering accuracy of 79.63\%
   for Reuter which ensures the better automatic text clustering.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, approaches based on query clustering in IR only take the
   keywords that belong to the queries into consideration, with the aim of
   calculating the similarity among them. In search engines, one of the
   factors that affects precision is the short lengths of queries. One way
   to tackle this problem is through the use of the context. Aiming to
   consider the context of queries, several measures have been proposed to
   calculate their inter-document similarity, which are known as
   Query-Sensitive Similarity Measure (QSSM). This paper presents a new
   QSSM called Query-Document Similarity Measure (QDSM), which is used to
   build clusters of similar search results. The goal of this measure is to
   provide clusters of better quality (i.e., clusters with more relevant
   documents) taking into account the context in which the queries are
   submitted. To achieve this goal, several experiments were carried out
   using four well-known algorithms in Information Retrieval (IR) along
   with the AOL Query Logs Dataset (AOL). Final results using Bisection
   K-Means and Average link show that the clusters built with QDSM provide
   better effectiveness than the clusters built with Cosine Similarity

Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{Extracting valuable insights from a large volume of unstructured data
   such as texts through clustering analysis is paramount to many big data
   applications. However, document clustering is challenged by the
   computational complexity of the underlying methods and the high
   dimensionality of data, especially when the number of required clusters
   is large. A fine-grained clustering solution is required to understand a
   data set that represents heterogeneous topics such as social media data.
   This paper presents the Fine-Grained document Clustering via Ranking
   (FGCR) approach which leverages the search engine capability of handling
   big data efficiently. Ranking scores from a search engine are used to
   calculate dynamic clusters' representations called loci in an
   unsupervised learning setting. Clustering decisions are efficiently made
   based on an optimal selection from a small subset of loci instead of the
   entire cluster set as in the conventional centroid-based clustering. A
   comprehensive empirical study on several social media data sets shows
   that FGCR is able to produce insightful and accurate fine-grained
   solution. Moreover, it is magnitudes faster and requires less
   computational resources compared to other state-of-the-art document
   clustering approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes three feature selection algorithms with feature
   weight scheme and dynamic dimension reduction for the text document
   clustering problem. Text document clustering is a new trend in text
   mining; in this process, text documents are separated into several
   coherent clusters according to carefully selected informative features
   by using proper evaluation function, which usually depends on term
   frequency. Informative features in each document are selected using
   feature selection methods. Genetic algorithm (GA), harmony search (HS)
   algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are the most
   successful feature selection methods established using a novel weighting
   scheme, namely, length feature weight (LFW), which depends on term
   frequency and appearance of features in other documents. A new dynamic
   dimension reduction (DDR) method is also provided to reduce the number
   of features used in clustering and thus improve the performance of the
   algorithms. Finally, k-mean, which is a popular clustering method, is
   used to cluster the set of text documents based on the terms (or
   features) obtained by dynamic reduction. Seven text mining benchmark
   text datasets of different sizes and complexities are evaluated.
   Analysis with k-mean shows that particle swarm optimization with length
   feature weight and dynamic reduction produces the optimal outcomes for
   almost all datasets tested. This paper provides new alternatives for
   text mining community to cluster text documents by using cohesive and
   informative features. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering plays an important role in data mining and machine

   Text clustering is first converted to its dual problem called word

   which can be used in the fuzzy k-means of the Chinese news keyword set.
   Based on the keyword clustering result, we can get text clustering

Abstract = {{The recent years have witnessed an increasing use of automated text
   clustering approaches and more particularly Vector Space Clustering
   (VSC) methods in the computational analysis of literary data including
   genre classification, theme analysis, stylometry, and authorship
   attribution. In spite of the effectiveness of VSC methods in resolving
   different problems in these disciplines and providing evidence-based
   research findings, the problem of feature selection remains a
   challenging one. For reliable text clustering applications, a clustering
   structure should be based on only and all the most distinctive features
   within a corpus. Although different term weighting approaches have been
   developed, the problem of identifying the most distinctive variables
   within a corpus remains challenging especially in the document
   clustering applications of literary texts. For this purpose, this study
   proposes a hybrid of statistical measures including variance analysis,
   term frequency-inverse document frequency, TF-IDF, and Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) for selecting only and all the most distinctive
   features that can be usefully used for generating more reliable document
   clustering that can be usefully used in authorship attribution tasks.
   The study is based on a corpus of 74 novels written by 18 novelists
   representing different literary traditions. Results indicate that the
   proposed model proved effective in the successful extraction of the most
   distinctive features within the datasets and thus generating reliable
   clustering structures that can be usefully used in different

   This scenario of divide and conquer strategy of FP Growth to reduce the

Abstract = {{Predicting occupational accident risk using both structured and
   unstructured (text) data is broadly an unexplored area of research.
   Unstructured texts, i.e., incident narratives often remain unutilized or
   under-utilized. Besides the explicit attributes present in the dataset,
   there exist a large number of hidden attributes in different forms,
   which are hardly explored by the traditional machine learning
   algorithms. Therefore, we propose a methodology that utilizes both
   text-based clustering, namely Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
   for unstructured text analysis and deep neural network (DNN) for
   prediction of accident risk using the accident data collected from a
   steel plant in India. EM-based DNN shows the maximum accuracy equal to
   83.59\% in the prediction of risk while compared to other algorithms,
   namely single DNN, support vector machine, and random forest. In
   addition, it is also explored that the use of text data enhances the
   prediction accuracy in accident analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new theory to quantify information in probability
   distributions and derive a new document representation model for text
   clustering and classification. By extending Shannon entropy to
   accommodate a non-linear relation between information and uncertainty,
   the proposed least information theory provides insight into how terms
   can be weighted based on their probability distributions in documents
   vs. in the collection. We derive two basic quantities for document
   representation: (1) LI Binary (LIB) which quantifies information due to
   the observation of a term's (binary) occurrence in a document; and (2)
   LI Frequency (LIF) which measures information for the observation of a
   randomly picked term from the document. The two quantities are computed
   based on terms' prior distributions in the entire collection and
   posterior distributions in a document. LIB and LIF can be used
   individually or combined to represent documents for text clustering and
   classification. Experiments on four benchmark text collections
   demonstrate strong performances of the proposed methods compared to
   classic TF{*}IDF. Particularly, the LIB{*}LIF weighting scheme, which
   combines LIB and LIF, consistently outperforms TF{*}IDF in terms of
   multiple evaluation metrics. The least information measure has a
   potentially broad range of applications beyond text clustering and
   classification.}},

Abstract = {{Text clustering is one of the efficient unsupervised learning techniques
   used to partition a huge number of text documents into a subset of

   problems, including text document clustering problems. In this paper, a
   comprehensive review is presented to show the most related
   nature-inspired algorithms that have been used in solving the text
   clustering problem. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted
   and analyzed to show the performance of the common well-know
   nature-inspired optimization algorithms in solving the text document
   clustering problems including Harmony Search (HS) Algorithm, Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm, Ant Colony
   Optimization (ACO), Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA), Cuckoo Search (CS)
   Algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Bat-inspired Algorithm (BA).
   Seven text benchmark datasets are used to validate the performance of
   the tested algorithms. The results showed that the performance of the
   well-known nurture-inspired optimization algorithms almost the same with

Title = {{Hybrid dimension reduction by integrating feature selection with feature
   extraction method for text clustering}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3105-3114}},

Abstract = {{High dimensionality of the feature space is one of the major concerns
   owing to computational complexity and accuracy consideration in the text
   clustering. Therefore, various dimension reduction methods have been
   introduced in the literature to select an informative subset (or
   sublist) of features. As each dimension reduction method uses a
   different strategy (aspect) to select a subset of features, it results
   in different feature sublists for the same dataset. Hence, a hybrid
   approach, which encompasses different aspects of feature relevance
   altogether for feature subset selection, receives considerable
   attention. Traditionally, union or intersection is used to merge feature
   sublists selected with different methods. The union approach selects all
   features and the intersection approach selects only common features from
   considered features sublists, which leads to increase the total number
   of features and loses some important features, respectively. Therefore,
   to take the advantage of one method and lessen the drawbacks of other, a
   novel integration approach namely modified union is proposed. This
   approach applies union on selected top ranked features and applies
   intersection on remaining features sublists. Hence, it ensures selection
   of top ranked as well as common features without increasing dimensions
   in the feature space much. In this study, feature selection methods term
   variance (TV) and document frequency (DF) are used for features'
   relevance score computation. Next, a feature extraction method principal
   component analysis (PCA) is applied to further reduce dimensions in the
   feature space without losing much information. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is tested on three benchmark datasets namely
   Reuters-21,578, Classic4, and WebKB. The obtained results are compared
   with TV, DF, and variants of the proposed hybrid dimension reduction
   method. The experimental studies clearly demonstrate that our proposed
   method improves clustering accuracy compared to the competitive methods.

Abstract = {{The fast-growing Internet results in massive amounts of text data. Due
   to the large volume of the unstructured format of text data, extracting
   relevant information and its analysis becomes very challenging. Text
   document clustering is a text-mining process that partitions the set of
   text-based documents into mutually exclusive clusters in such a way that
   documents within the same group are similar to each other, while
   documents from different clusters differ based on the content. One of
   the biggest challenges in text clustering is partitioning the collection
   of text data by measuring the relevance of the content in the documents.
   Addressing this issue, in this work a hybrid swarm intelligence
   algorithm with a K-means algorithm is proposed for text clustering.
   First, the hybrid fruit-fly optimization algorithm is tested on ten
   unconstrained CEC2019 benchmark functions. Next, the proposed method is
   evaluated on six standard benchmark text datasets. The experimental
   evaluation on the unconstrained functions, as well as on text-based
   documents, indicated that the proposed approach is robust and superior
   to other state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering can be applied in document organisation and
   browsing, document summarisation and classification. The identification
   of an appropriate representation for textual documents is extremely
   important for the performance of clustering or classification
   algorithms. Textual documents suffer from the high dimensionality and
   irrelevancy of text features. Besides, conventional clustering
   algorithms suffer from several shortcomings, such as slow convergence
   and sensitivity to the initial value. To tackle the problems of
   conventional clustering algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms are
   frequently applied to clustering. In this paper, an improved ant
   clustering algorithm is presented, where two novel heuristic methods are
   proposed to enhance the clustering quality of ant-based clustering. In
   addition, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is used to represent
   textual documents in a compact and efficient way. The clustering quality
   of the proposed ant clustering algorithm is compared to the conventional
   clustering algorithms using 25 text benchmarks in terms of F-measure
   values. The experimental results indicate that the proposed clustering
   scheme outperforms the compared conventional and metaheuristic
   clustering methods for textual documents.}},

   potential cluster, and FGSDMM+ will create a new cluster to store this
   document. Later documents will choose one of the non-empty clusters or
   the potential cluster with probabilities derived from the Dirichlet
   multinomial mixture model. Each time a document chooses the potential
   cluster, FGSDMM+ will create a new cluster to store that document and
   decrease the probability of later documents choosing the potential
   cluster. After initialization, FGSDMM+ will run a collapsed Gibbs
   sampling algorithm several times to obtain the final clustering result.
   Our extensive experimental study shows that FGSDMM+ can achieve better
   performance than three other clustering methods on both short and long
   text datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is a text mining technique used to provide better
   document search and browsing in digital libraries or online corpora. In
   this research, a vector representation of concepts of diseases and
   similarity measurement between concepts are proposed. They identify the
   closest concepts of diseases in the context of a corpus. Each document
   is represented by using the vector space model. A weight scheme is
   proposed to consider both local content and associations between
   concepts. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are often used as document
   clustering algorithm. The vector projection and visualization features
   of SOM enable visualization and analysis of the cluster distribution and
   relationships on the two dimensional space. The Davies-Bouldin index is
   used to validate the clusters based on the visualized cluster
   distributions. The results show that the proposed document clustering
   framework generates meaningful clusters and can facilitate clustering
   visualization and information retrieval based on the concepts of
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) models have been successful in
   clustering short texts. However, the word co-occurrence information that
   can be captured by these models is limited to the short text corpus
   itself. If two words have strong relatedness but rarely co-occurring in
   short texts, these models can not fully capture the semantic relatedness
   between the two words. In this paper, we propose a novel model by
   incorporating word-word correlation into DMM, called WDMM. By
   constructing a sparse graph using word-word relationship, our model
   expands each short text using their neighboring words in each text that
   can help to solve the problem of sparseness in short texts. Therefore,
   the cluster label of each text is not only influenced by its words, but
   decided by their similar words in this corpus. Experimental results on
   real-world datasets demonstrated the substantial superiority of our WDMM
   model over the state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of e-commerce and logistics, people want to
   increase the efficiency of order picking in warehouses to meet the
   growing volume of orders. Optimizing the distribution of items in the
   warehouse location is one of the main ways to improve the efficiency of
   order picking. Some researchers have carried out correlation analysis to
   optimize the allocation of storage space in the case of strong
   correlation among order items. In the case of weak correlation among
   items, the method of pure correlation analysis is no longer applicable.
   In response to this situation, this paper proposes an algorithm based on
   text clustering and correlation analysis. In the case of weak
   correlation among items, this algorithm can optimize warehouse storage
   location allocation, aiming to reduce the total distance of order
   picking operations. In this paper, the real business history orders is
   used to simulate the experiment. By comparing with two other
   commonly-used storage location allocation algorithms, the allocation of
   the storage location determined by the algorithm proposed in this paper
   reduces significantly the total distance of the order picking operation.}},

Abstract = {{The tedious challenging of Big Data is to store and retrieve of required
   data from the search engines. Problem Defined There is an obligation for
   the quick and efficient retrieval of useful information for the many
   organizations. The elementary idea is to arrange these computing files
   of organization into individual folders in an hierarchical order of
   folders. Manually, to order these files into folders, there is an ardent
   need to know about the file contents and name of the files to give
   impression of files, so that it provides an alignment of certain set of
   files as a bunch. Problem Statement Manual grouping of files has its own
   complications, for example when these files are in numerous amounts and
   also their contents cannot be illustrious by their labels. Therefore,
   it's an intense requirement for Document clustering with data processing
   machines for enthusiastic results. Existing System A couple of analyzers
   are impending with dynamic algorithms and comprehensive analogy of
   extant algorithms, but, yet, these have been restricted to organizations
   and colleges. After recent updated rules of NMF their raised a self
   interest in document clustering. These rules gave trust in its
   performances with better results when compared to Latent Semantic
   Indexing with Singular Value Decomposition. Proposed System A new
   working miniature called Novel K-means Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
   (KNMF) is implemented using renovated guidelines of NMF which has been
   diagnosed for clustering documents consequently. A new data set called
   Newsgroup20 is considered for the exploratory purpose. Removal of common
   clutter/stop words using keywords from Key Phrase Extraction Algorithm
   and a new proposed Iterated Lovin stemming will be utilized in
   preprocessing step inassisting to KNMF. Compared to the Porter stemmer
   and Lovins stemmer algorithms, Iterative Lovins algorithm is providing
   5\% more reduction. 60\% of the document terms are been minimized to
   root as remaining terms are already root words. Eventually, an appeal to
   these processes named ``Progressive Text mining radical{''} is developed
   inlateral exertion of K-Means algorithm from the defined Apache Mahout
   Project which is used to analyze the performance of the MapReduce
   framework in Hadoop.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an innovative Chinese register study based on
   regression analysis for sentence length distribution and text
   clustering. Although end of sentence is not conventionally marked in
   Chinese, we resolve this issue by assuming that segments between
   periods, question marks, and exclamation marks are sentences, which can
   be further divided into simple sentences and compound sentences. We also
   assume that segments between punctuation marks that express pauses in
   utterances form sentences (i.e., clauses). Using regression analysis, we
   find that the frequency distribution of sentence and clause lengths in
   Chinese can be fitted by the formula F = aL(b)c(L), where L is
   sentence/clause length. Texts from different registers give rise to
   different fitted values of the parameters, and hence can serve to
   differentiate these registers. Finally, we use these parameters to
   represent and cluster texts from different registers. The successful
   text clustering results further prove that the parameters of the fitted
   results are reliable linguistic characteristics for different registers.
   In terms of linguistic theories, our study shows that it is just as
   effective to model sentence length in Chinese using sociological words
   (i.e., characters) as it is using linguistic words.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering is crucial to automated document management,
   especially for the fast-growing volume of textual documents available
   digitally. Traditional lexicon-based approaches depend on document
   content analysis and measure overlap of the feature vectors representing
   different documents, which cannot effectively address word mismatch or
   ambiguity problems. Alternative query expansion and local context
   discovery approaches are developed but suffer from limited efficiency
   and effectiveness, because the large number of expanded terms create
   noise and increase the dimensionality and complexity of the overall
   feature space. Several techniques extend lexicon-based analysis by
   incorporating latent semantic indexing but produce less comprehensible
   clustering results and questionable performance. We instead propose a
   concept-based document representation and clustering (CDRC) technique
   and empirically examine its effectiveness using 433 articles concerning
   information systems and technology, randomly selected from a popular
   digital library. Our evaluation includes two widely used benchmark
   techniques and shows that CDRC outperforms them. Overall, our results
   reveal that clustering documents at an ontology-based, concept-based
   level is more effective than techniques using lexicon-based document
   features and can generate more comprehensible clustering results.}},

Abstract = {{In the information age we are living in today, not only are we
   interested in accessing multimedia objects such as documents, videos,
   etc. but also in searching for professional experts, people or
   celebrities, possibly for professional needs or just for fun.
   Information access systems need to be able to extract and exploit
   various sources of information (usually in text format) about such
   individuals, and to represent them in a suitable way usually in the form
   of a profile. In this article, we tackle the problems of profile-based
   expert recommendation and document filtering from a machine learning
   perspective by clustering expert textual sources to build profiles and
   capture the different hidden topics in which the experts are interested.
   The experts will then be represented by means of multi-faceted profiles.
   Our experiments show that this is a valid technique to improve the
   performance of expert finding and document filtering. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Since the last decade, researchers have been concentrating on high
   quality clustering methods for the effective analysis of the growing
   data. Algorithms inspired by nature have become part of a widely used
   class of computing methods, because of their ability to adjust to
   variety of conditions. These nature inspired algorithms have been
   frequently used for solving complex, real-world optimization problems.
   In recent years, they have emerged as powerful optimization techniques.
   These algorithms inspired by the cooperative behavior of social animals
   have the ability to provide better solutions for clustering problems.
   Social Spider Optimization (SSO) is a population based stochastic
   optimization algorithm. It has been used to solve many complicated
   optimization problems. It simulates the behavior of social spiders. In
   this paper, a new and more effective implementation of SSO (ESSOSC) for
   solving text document clustering problem is specified by using single
   cluster implementation for each spider.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a heuristic-based algorithm to improve the
   initial seeding of the k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed
   algorithm primarily aims to improve the initial choice of the centroids
   used by the k-means algorithm and also ensure that the requisite number
   of clusters is always returned in every run of the algorithm. Thus, the
   use of the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the possibility of
   k-means converging to a locally optimal solution. The paper explores the
   genetic algorithm framework to obtain the original seed points and
   couples this with the use of the differential evolution heuristic to
   obtain the requisite number of clusters. We have examined the
   performance of the proposed algorithm in the case of clustering text
   documents as such corpus often have significantly large number of data
   points and also require the formation of a large number of clusters. The
   results obtained have been compared with basic implementations of the
   k-means algorithm using standard parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The Evolving tree (ETree) is a hierarchical clustering and visualization
   model that allows the number of clusters to grow and evolve with new
   data samples in an online learning manner. While many hierarchical
   clustering models are available in the literature, ETree stands out
   because of its visualization capability. It is an enhancement of the
   Self-Organizing Map, a famous and useful clustering and visualization
   model. ETree organises the trained data samples in the form of a tree
   structure for better presentation and visualization especially for
   high-dimensional data samples. Even though ETree has been used in a
   number of applications, its use in textual document clustering and
   visualization is limited. In this paper, ETree is modified and deployed
   as a useful model for undertaking textual documents clustering and
   visualization problems. We introduce a new local re-learning procedure
   that allows the tree structure to grow and adapt to new features, i.e.,
   new words from new textual documents. The performance of the proposed
   ETree model is evaluated with two (one benchmark and one real) document
   data sets. A number of key aspects of the proposed ETree model, which
   include its topology representation, learning time, as well as recall
   and precision rates, are evaluated. The results show that the proposed
   local re-learning procedure is useful for handling increasing number of
   features incrementally. In summary, this study contributes towards a
   modified ETree model and its use in a new domain, i.e., textual document
   clustering and visualization.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering of text documents is the quickest developing research area,
   because of the availability of vast amount of information in an

   merging optimization clustering (AMOC) algorithm was performed for the
   formation of clusters and then implemented the optimization model using
   the variance ratio criterion (VRC) as fitness function. Second, this
   paper combines TS and PSO algorithm to use the exploration of both
   algorithms and to avoid flaws of both algorithms. The testing of TSPSO
   algorithm is performed on several standard datasets, and the results are
   compared with PSO and TS. So, the proposed TSPSO is efficient and
   effective for the problem of document clustering; we have tested PSO,
   TS, and our proposed TSPSO algorithm on various text document

Abstract = {{Background: Since medical research based on big data has become more
   common, the community's interest and effort to analyze a large amount of
   semistructured or unstructured text data, such as examination reports,
   have rapidly increased. However, these large-scale text data are often
   not readily applicable to analysis owing to typographical errors,
   inconsistencies, or data entry problems. Therefore, an efficient data
   cleaning process is required to ensure the veracity of such data.
   Objective: In this paper, we proposed an efficient data cleaning process
   for large-scale medical text data, which employs text clustering methods
   and value-converting technique, and evaluated its performance with
   medical examination text data.
   Methods: The proposed data cleaning process consists of text clustering
   and value-merging. In the text clustering step, we suggested the use of
   key collision and nearest neighbor methods in a complementary manner.
   Words (called values) in the same cluster would be expected as a correct
   value and its wrong representations. In the value-converting step, wrong
   values for each identified cluster would be converted into their correct
   value. We applied these data cleaning process to 574,266 stool
   examination reports produced for parasite analysis at Samsung Medical
   Center from 1995 to 2015. The performance of the proposed process was
   examined and compared with data cleaning processes based on a single
   clustering method. We used OpenRefine 2.7, an open source application
   that provides various text clustering methods and an efficient user
   interface for value-converting with common-value suggestion.
   Results: A total of 1,167,104 words in stool examination reports were
   surveyed. In the data cleaning process, we discovered 30 correct words
   and 45 patterns of typographical errors and duplicates. We observed high
   correction rates for words with typographical errors (98.61\%) and
   typographical error patterns (97.78\%). The resulting data accuracy was
   nearly 100\% based on the number of total words.
   Conclusions: Our data cleaning process based on the combinatorial use of
   key collision and nearest neighbor methods provides an efficient
   cleaning of large-scale text data and hence improves data accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering aims at grouping the documents that are coherent
   internally with substantial difference amongst different groups. Due to
   huge availability of documents, the clustering face scalability and
   accuracy issues. Moreover, there is a dearth for a tool that performs
   clustering of such voluminous data efficiently. Conventional models
   focus either on fully centralized or fully distributed approach for
   document clustering. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach to
   perform document clustering by modifying the conventional Self
   Organizing Map (SOM). The contribution of this work is threefold. The
   first is a distributed approach to pre-process the documents; the second
   being an adaptive bottom-up approach towards document clustering and the
   third being a neighbourhood model suitable for Ring Topology for
   document clustering. Experimentation on real datasets and comparison
   with traditional SOM show the efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In-depth understanding of a fault cause in electricity distribution
   network has always been a paramount importance to Distributed Network
   Operators for reliable power supply. Faults in the network have direct
   effect on its stability, availability, and maintenance; so, the quick
   elimination, prevention, and avoidance of fault causes that generated
   them, are of special interest. Possible opportunity to understanding of
   the causes and correlation of the factors where future faults may arise
   can significantly help electricity distribution operators who happen to
   be accountable to detect and repair such faults. Every distribution
   network asset has a different level of performance and reliability, and
   which may vary depend on environmental conditions. Faults identifying in
   distribution network has rich literature but a very few studies had been
   done on understanding the factors that contribute to LV Faults using
   data mining and machine learning techniques. Since there are lack of
   studies on faults identifying in distribution network with data mining,
   this study will formulate a starting point. The aim of this paper is to
   use the association rule mining and clustering techniques to understand
   the various hidden patterns from the faults database. The uncovered
   relationship can be represented in the form of Association rules and
   clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Processing the normal text is quite easier and the information can be
   efficiently retrieved. There are various algorithms have been already
   proposed for normal text retrieval. Whereas retrieving the geospatial
   information are very complex due to nature of the data. It needs
   supplementary processes to be performed. Since geospatial data contains
   complex information like location and direction. To effectively handle
   thegeospatial queries, a novel Semantic and Feature Aggregated
   Information Retrieval is proposed in this paper. Preliminary, there are
   four steps need to be perform, they are Clustering, Indexing, Retrieval
   and Ranking. Also, Context based Query Weighting (CQW) approach is
   proposed to cluster the documents present in the corpus and indexing is
   based on multilevel hashing. Feature Probability and Density (FPD)
   technique is utilized to retrieve the document which matches the user
   query information. The Semantic Density (SD) technique is used to rank
   the retrieved documents. The experimental results shows that the
   proposed SFAIR technique provides better results than the existing
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Information Retrieval is the activity of finding documents which is of
   unstructured nature and it should satisfy user's information needs. The
   term ``IR{''} refers to the retrieval of unstructured records, that is,
   records which are free-form natural language text. There are various
   models for weighting terms of corpus documents and query terms. The
   probabilistic model captures the IR problem using a probabilistic
   framework, It tries to find the probability that a document will be
   relevant to a user query or not. In this we have a collection of user
   query, and there is an ideal answer set for each query, first of all
   initial set of documents are retrieved from the corpus or collection of
   documents. User inspects these documents for searching the relevant
   documents, then IR system use this information to find the description
   to get the ideal answer set. This work is carried out to analyze and
   evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of various probabilistic models
   with use of new data set i.e; FIRE 2011. The experiments were performed
   with different variants of probabilistic models. Terrier 3.5, which is
   an open search engine was used for all experiments and evaluation. Our
   result shows that IFB2 model gives the highest precision values with the
   news corpus dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Arabic document indexing is a challenging process due to the complex
   morphological nature of the Arabic language. Methods of document
   indexing in the literature relied on applying morphological schemes to
   extract terms. These morphological schemes mainly depend on root
   extraction and stemming. This paper proposes a simple document indexing
   method based on selecting only definite words (that have the prefix AL,
   or it is acceptable to have this prefix). The words that preceding
   (and/or) succeeding these definite words are also considered. The
   proposed method is tested using the TREC-2001/2002 Arabic test
   collection. The proposed method outperforms selecting all terms, either
   without stemming, or stemmed by the Light10 stemmer, for example,
   indexing documents by selecting definite words and words that come after
   them enhances the Mean average Precision of the Light10 by 4.4\%, and at
   the same time decreases the index size by 6.1\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a classifier based retrieval scheme for
   efficiently and accurately retrieving relevant documents. We use SVM
   classifiers for word retrieval, and argue that the classifier based
   solutions can be superior to the OCR based solutions in many practical
   situations. We overcome the practical limitations of the classifier
   based solution in terms of limited vocabulary support, and availability
   of training data. In order to overcome these limitations, we design a
   one-shot learning scheme for dynamically synthesizing classifiers. Given
   a set of SVM classifiers, we appropriately join them to create novel
   classifiers. This extends the classifier based retrieval paradigm to an
   unlimited number of classes (words) present in a language. We validate
   our method on multiple datasets, and compare it with popular
   alternatives like OCR and wordspotting. Even on a language like English,
   where OCRs have been fairly advanced, our method yields comparable or
   even superior results. Our results are significant since we do not use
   any language specific post-processing for obtaining this performance.
   For better accuracy of the retrieved list, we use query expansion. This
   also allows us to seamlessly adapt our solution to new fonts, styles and
   collections.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend several well-known document listing problems to
   the case when documents contain a substring that approximately matches
   the query pattern. We study the scenario when the query string can
   contain a wildcard symbol that matches any alphabet symbol; all
   documents that match a query pattern with one wildcard must be
   enumerated. We describe a linear space data structure that reports all
   documents containing a substring Pin O(vertical bar P vertical bar +
   sigma root logloglog n + docc) time, where sigma is the alphabet size
   and docc is the number of listed documents. We also describe a succinct
   solution for this problem, as well as a solution for an extension of
   this problem. Furthermore our approach enables us to obtain an O (n
   sigma)-space data structure that enumerates all documents containing
   both a pattern P-1 and a pattern P-2 in the special case when P-1 and
   P-2 differ in one symbol. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Information technology has explored the growth of text documents data in
   many organizations and the structural arrangement of voluminous data is
   a complex task. Handling the text document data is a challenging process
   involving not only the training of models but also numerous additional
   procedures, e.g., data pre-processing, transformation, and
   dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we describe the system's
   architecture, the technical challenges, and the novel solution we have
   built. We propose a Recurrent Convolutional Neural network (RCNN), based
   text information retrieval system which efficiently retrieves the text
   documents and information for the user query. Pre-processing using
   tokenization and stemming, retrieval using TF-IDF (Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and RCNN classifier which
   captures the contextual information is implemented. A real-time advanced
   search system is developed on a huge set of MAHE University dataset. The
   performance of the proposed text document retrieval system is compared
   with other existing algorithms and the efficacy of the method is
   discussed. The proposed RCNN-based text document information retrieval
   model performs better in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. A
   high-quality and high-performance text document retrieval search system
   is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the fastest-growing string collections today are repetitive,
   that is, most of the constituent documents are similar to many others.
   As these collections keep growing, a key approach to handling them is to
   exploit their repetitiveness, which can reduce their space usage by
   orders of magnitude. We study the problem of indexing repetitive string
   collections in order to perform efficient document retrieval operations
   on them. Document retrieval problems are routinely solved by search
   engines on large natural language collections, but the techniques are
   less developed on generic string collections. The case of repetitive
   string collections is even less understood, and there are very few
   existing solutions. We develop two novel ideas, interleaved LCPs and
   precomputed document lists, that yield highly compressed indexes solving
   the problem of document listing (find all the documents where a string
   appears), top-k document retrieval (find the k documents where a string
   appears most often), and document counting (count the number of
   documents where a string appears). We also show that a classical data
   structure supporting the latter query becomes highly compressible on
   repetitive data. Finally, we show how the tools we developed can be
   combined to solve ranked conjunctive and disjunctive multi-term queries
   under the simple model of relevance. We thoroughly evaluate the
   resulting techniques in various real-life repetitiveness scenarios, and
   recommend the best choices for each case.}},

Abstract = {{Given an input document d, the problem of local text reuse detection is
   to detect from a given documents collection, all the possible reused
   passages between d and the other documents. Comparing the passages of
   document d with the passages of every other document in the collection
   is obviously infeasible especially with large collections such as the
   Web. Therefore, selecting a subset of the documents that potentially
   contains reused text with d becomes a major step in the detection
   problem. This paper describes a new efficient approach of query
   formulation to retrieve Arabic-based candidate source documents from the
   Web. We evaluated the work using a collection of documents especially
   constructed for this work. The experiments show that on average, 79.97\%
   of the Web documents used in the reused cases were successfully
   retrieved.}},

Abstract = {{Learning to hash via generative models has became a promising paradigm
   for fast similarity search in document retrieval. The binary hash codes
   are treated as Bernoulli latent variables when training a variational
   autoencoder (VAE). However, the prior of discrete distribution (i.e.,
   Bernoulli distribution) is short of some structure regularization to
   generate more efficient binary codes. In this paper, we present an
   end-to-end Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) for text hashing to avoid
   in-differentiable operators in the reparameterization trick, where the
   latent variables can be imposed to any discrete priors we can sample by
   using adversarial learning. Moreover, we can generate more efficient
   discrete codes by imposing a structural constraint on priors like the
   bit balance constraint. Our experiments show that the proposed model is
   competitive to the state of the art methods on both unsupervised and
   supervised scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the task of document retrieval based on the degree
   of document relatedness to the meanings of a query by presenting a
   semantic-enabled language model. Our model relies on the use of semantic
   linking systems for forming a graph representation of documents and
   queries, where nodes represent concepts extracted from documents and
   edges represent semantic relatedness between concepts. Based on this
   graph, our model adopts a probabilistic reasoning model for calculating
   the conditional probability of a query concept given values assigned to
   document concepts. We present an integration framework for interpolating
   other retrieval systems with the presented model in this paper. Our
   empirical experiments on a number of TREC collections show that the
   semantic retrieval has a synergetic impact on the results obtained
   through state of the art keyword-based approaches, and the consideration
   of semantic information obtained from entity linking on queries and
   documents can complement and enhance the performance of other retrieval
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Let D = \{T-1, T-2, ..., T-D\} be a collection of D documents having n
   characters in total. Given two patterns P and Q, and an integer k > 0,
   we consider the following queries.
   top-k forbidden pattern query: Among all documents containing P, but not
   Q, report the k documents most relevant to P.
   top-k two pattern query: Among all documents that contain both P and Q,
   report the k documents most relevant to P.
   For the above two queries, we provide a linear space index with O
   (vertical bar P vertical bar + vertical bar Q vertical bar + root nk)
   query time, under some standard relevance functions such as PageRank and
   TermFrequency. The document listing version of the above two problems
   asks to report all t documents that either contain P, but not Q, or
   contain both P and Q, depending on the query type. As a corollary of the
   top-k result, we obtain a linear space and O (vertical bar P vertical
   bar + vertical bar Q vertical bar + root nt) query time solution for the
   document listing problems. We conjecture that any significant
   improvement over these results is highly unlikely. We also consider the
   scenario when the query consists of more than two patterns. Finally, we
   present space-efficient indexes for these problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to the comparatively more recent emergence of data retrieval systems
   than text-based search engines, the former have still yet to achieve
   similar maturity in terms of standards and techniques. Most of the
   existing solutions for data retrieval are more or less makeshift
   adaptations of text retrieval systems rather than purpose-built
   solutions specially designed to cater to the particular peculiarities,
   subtleties, and unique requirements of research datasets. In this paper
   we probe into the key differences between text and data retrieval that
   bear practical relevance to the retrieval question; these differences we
   demonstrate by evaluating some representative examples of research data
   repositories as well as presenting findings from previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Let D be a collection of D documents, which are strings over an alphabet
   of size a, of total length n. We describe a data structure that uses
   linear space and reports k most relevant documents that contain a query
   pattern P, which is a string of length p packed in p/ log(sigma) n
   words, in time O(p/ log(sigma) n+ k). This is optimal in the RAM model
   in the general case where log D = Theta(logn), and involves a novel
   RAM-optimal suffix tree search. Our construction supports an ample set
   of important relevance measures, such as the number of times P appears
   in a document (called term frequency), a fixed document importance, and
   the minimal distance between two occurrences of P in a document. When
   log D = o(logn), we show how to reduce the space of the data structure
   from O(n log n) to O(n(log sigma + log D log log n)) bits, and to
   O(n(log sigma- + log D)) bits in the case of the popular term frequency
   measure of relevance, at the price of an additive term O(log
   epsilon(sigma) n) in the query time, for any constant epsilon > 0. We
   also consider the dynamic scenario, where documents can be inserted and
   deleted from the collection. We obtain linear space and query time
   O(p(log log n)(2)/ log(sigma) n + log n + k log log k), whereas
   insertions and deletions require O(log(l+epsilon) (sigma) n) time per
   symbol, for any constant epsilon > 0. Finally, we consider an extended
   static scenario where an extra parameter par(P, d) is defined, and the
   query must retrieve only documents d such that par(P, d) epsilon {[}T1,
   T2], where this range is specified at query time. We solve these queries
   using linear space and O(p/ log (sigma) n + log (1+epsilon) n+ k loge n)
   time, for any constant epsilon > 0. Our technique is to translate these
   top-k problems into multidimensional geometric search problems. As a
   bonus, we describe some improvements to those problems.}},

Abstract = {{Medical information is valuable for a health care professional to
   empower diagnosis and clinical decision process. In addition, it can
   also support communities with health knowledge to support healthy

   such information with the semantically better result. In this paper, we
   propose a framework of lightweight semantic-based medical document
   retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia. The medical information is focused on
   diagnosis, etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, and
   guidelines. The framework firstly annotates queries' by using the
   ontology, analyse the information networks within the ontology and
   extracts the context of the queries. When a query falls within one
   context of disease information, a modified search query will be then
   generated and passed to an existing keyword-based search result. The
   framework is evaluated using a case study in infectious tropical disease
   domain. The evaluation results show that the framework could perform
   well with precision equals or more than 0.9 to find the relevant medical
   document through the semantic networks and the enhancement process.}},

Abstract = {{Eugene Garfield's name, like that of any prolific author, can designate
   both an oeuvre and a person. That duality is explored here with pennant
   diagrams, a decade-old technique that can structure information about
   both oeuvres and persons in one scatterplot. Such diagrams are not
   readily made now, but may have a place in recommender systems of the
   future. This paper recapitulates the basics of creating and
   understanding them. In pennants, every term in a bibliometric
   distribution is weighted with a version of the TF {*} IDF formula from
   information retrieval. The distributions are generated by a seed term,
   such as a cited author's name or a subject phrase, and consist of terms
   that co-occur with the seed in a database. TF {*} IDF orders the terms
   by relevance and specificity with respect to the seed-an outcome
   interpretable in light of relevance theory from linguistic pragmatics.
   Garfield's name appears illustratively as a seed in one pennant and as a
   co-cited author in five others. Another example shows works by him and
   others that co-occur with the phrase ``Citation Analysis{''} in
   Scisearch. Pennants are richly suggestive about authors, and here they
   are linked to a fruitful idea of Garfield's that appeared in his first
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Finding a document is one of the most time consuming and laborious task
   for a user and could affect the overall productivity of an individual in
   a workforce. Even if the user finds a document by himself/herself, it is
   still cumbersome to remember the file location of every document present
   in the computer system considering their volatile nature. For instance,
   files may be moved from one location to another, deleted, renamed, etc.
   Over time, it is also probable that the user forgets the actual name of
   the document and the content related to the document. The abstractive
   text summarizer implemented in Exploradar provides a summary of user
   documents. Using the user query, Exploradar provides the best results of
   the documents present in the user system that includes the file system
   and databases. Further, to simplify the problem of remembering the
   contents in a document, Exploradar classifies documents into different
   domains/tags that help the user in faster document retrieval.}},

Title = {{LocalContent: a personal scientific document retrieval system}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{373-385}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel personal
   scientific document retrieval system. The most common approach taken for
   the storage of personal documents is to construct a hierarchical folder
   structure. Most users prefer searching for documents by manually
   traversing their organizational hierarchy until reaching the location
   where the target item is stored, then locating the specific documents
   within its directory or folder. However, this is very time-consuming,
   especially when the number of personal scientific documents is very
   large. Unfortunately, related personal information management (PIM)
   systems, which provide solutions for managing various types of personal
   information, have thus far made little progress at managing personal
   scientific documents.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, we introduce the design of
   a personal scientific document retrieval system, namely, LocalContent.
   It is composed of database indexing and retrieval stages. During
   indexing, term feature extraction from scientific documents is performed
   by the natural language processing technique. The extracted terms are
   stored in the inverted index for later retrieval. For retrieval, a
   graphical user interface is provided by LocalContent, which allows users
   to search their personal scientific documents.
   Findings - The evaluation results based on 20 different personal
   archives taken from 20 graduate students show that LocalContent is
   simple to use and can facilitate the search for relevant scientific
   documents. Moreover, these users were willing to have a system which
   provides specialized search functions like LocalContent to explore their
   personal scientific documents in the future.
   Originality/value - LocalContent is a novel scientific document
   retrieval system and provides several particular functions of
   LocalContent including displaying the content summary of the query term
   frequency in each specific section of the retrieved documents, querying
   by local section specification and providing a number of recommended
   keywords related to the query terms.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of technology resulted in the extensive
   information distribution. It takes a system that can organize a set of
   information and simplify information search. The concept of retrieval
   system can simplify information search process. Current studies on
   information searching are dominated by documents in English, yet very
   few about documents in Indonesian. Therefore this study focuses on
   document search in Indonesian language using vector space method. The
   vector space method processes data already in the index to calculate the
   value of similarity with the user-provided query. The result is a list
   of ranked and relevant documents to the user-provided query. The
   performance results obtained by the system were the average value of
   precision 0.45, recall 0.96, and f-measure 0.54. The system produced a
   high recall value compared to precision in the document search process.
   This study shows that the vector space method is able to search and
   produce relevant documents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a classifier based automatic document retrieval
   system for accurately retrieving relevant documents and assigning them
   to proper workflow in the application. Documents present in archives
   oftentimes become illegible or distorted with time. Hence the system
   will first he used to recognize those distorted characters and then
   document text classification will be done using supervised machine
   learning. Language specific post-processing is not used by the system
   for obtaining this performance. It can also adapt to new fonts, styles
   and collections. The given system achieves an efficiency of up to 94\%

Abstract = {{With the daily-increasing development of science, various methods have
   been designed to more and better retrieve the scientific documents based
   on the need and search of users. For some documents in the various
   scientific databases, no complete information exists and the users have
   to observe the inside of a document in order to catch up with its
   metadata inclusion the authors, their affiliations, the references cited
   and etc. Therefore, presence of a method based on extracting the
   information based on the available structural and geometrical properties
   in a document can assist the recovery of related and required documents.
   In addition, the available pitfall in the relational data based is the
   lack of direct and indirect relationships between the availabilities of
   each system for which a graph-oriented database can establish the
   relations between these availabilities. In this respect, after
   extracting metadata using the geometrical properties of document and
   using a graph-oriented model, the relations between various documents'
   availabilities such as authors, conferences, subjects and keywords and
   etc. are modeled in order to retrieve the information more effectively.
   The extracted data are refined and stored in the graph model and will be
   available for a user via a web-based user interface. To produce the
   results of each search, the related documents will be retrieved based on
   the graph relations and be weighed according to the rate of relatedness
   of each document and the number of references. In order to evaluate the
   proposed method, PubMed Database is used. The results of experiments
   show the proposed methods outperformed 60\% in contrast to the PubMed
   Database search engine in terms of the retrieved documents. Furthermore,
   based in the F-measure, and nDCG-measure of proposed method considerably
   outperformed the PubMed Database search engine in terms of the quality
   of retrieved documents.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in deep learning have led to a significant
   innovation in various classic and practical subjects, including speech
   recognition, computer vision, question answering, information retrieval
   and so on. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), language
   representations learned by referring to autoregressive language modeling
   or autoencoding have shown giant successes in many downstream tasks, so
   the school of studies have become a major stream of research recently.
   Because the immenseness of multimedia data along with speech have spread
   around the world in our daily life, spoken document retrieval (SDR),
   which aims at retrieving relevant multimedia contents to satisfy users'
   queries, has become an important research subject in the past decades.
   Targeting on enhancing the SDR performance, the paper concentrates on
   proposing a neural retrieval framework, which assembles the merits of
   using language modeling (LM) mechanism in SDR and leveraging the
   abstractive information learned by the language representation models.
   Consequently, to our knowledge, this is a pioneer study on supervised
   training of a neural LM-based SDR framework, especially combined with
   the pretrained language representation methods. A series of empirical
   SDR experiments conducted on a benchmark collection demonstrate the good
   efficacy of the proposed framework, compared to several existing strong
   baseline systems.}},

Abstract = {{Document retrieval structures index a collection of string documents, to
   retrieve those that are relevant to query strings p: document listing
   retrieves all documents where p appears; top k retrieval retrieves the k
   most relevant of those. Classical structures use too much space in
   practice. Most current research uses compressed suffix arrays, but fast
   indices still use 17-21 bpc (bits per character), whereas small ones
   take milliseconds per returned answer. We present the first document
   retrieval structures based on Lempel-Ziv compression, precisely LZ78.
   Our structures use 7-10 bpc and dominate a large part of the space/time
   tradeoffs. They also enable more efficient partial or approximate
   answers: our document listing outputs the first 75\%-80\% of the answers
   at a rate of one per microsecond; for top-k retrieval we return a result
   of 90\% quality at the same rate and using just 4-6 bpc. This
   outperforms current indices by a wide margin. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Introduction to the Semantic Web is the chances for easier and effective
   access to the constantly increasing heterogeneous data on the Web.
   Currently, the data is able to be retrieved semantically rather than
   through traditional keyword based searches, which usually return lots of
   irrelevant information. However, one of the main challenges of the
   Semantic Web is that data are stored in a structured RDF triple format
   and are retrieved using complex structured triple represented queries,
   such as SPARQL, instead of preferred natural language queries and this
   problem remains subject to research. The proposed AutoSDoR, meaning
   Automated Semantic Document Retrieval, enables the semantic formulation
   of natural language queries to structured triple representation based on
   the machine learning approach in order to retrieve documents from the
   structured RDF triple format. Additionally the research goes beyond
   small fragment queries, such as in FREyA to paragraph length query.
   Automatic disambiguation of query terms that are not covered in WordNet
   is also proposed, which contributes to the increase in precision and
   recall of the retrieved document.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present three techniques for incorporating syntactic
   metadata in a textual retrieval system. The first technique involves
   just a syntactic analysis of the query and it generates a different
   weight for each term of the query, depending on its grammar category in
   the query phrase. These weights will be used for each term in the
   retrieval process. The second technique involves a storage optimization
   of the system's inverted index that is the inverse index will store only
   terms that are subjects or predicates in the document they appear in.
   Finally, the third technique builds a full syntactic index, meaning that
   for each term in the term collection, the inverse index stores besides
   the term-frequency and the inverse-document-frequency, also the grammar
   category of the term for each of its occurrences in a document.}},

Abstract = {{Domain specific information retrieval process has been a prominent and
   ongoing research in the field of natural language processing. Many
   researchers have incorporated different techniques to overcome the
   technical and domain specificity and provide a mature model for various
   domains of interest. The main bottleneck in these studies is the heavy
   coupling of domain experts, that makes the entire process to be time
   consuming and cumbersome. In this study, we have developed three novel
   models which are compared against a golden standard generated via the on
   line repositories provided, specifically for the legal domain. The three
   different models incorporated vector space representations of the legal
   domain, where document vector generation was done in two different
   mechanisms and as an ensemble of the above two. This study contains the
   research being carried out in the process of representing legal case
   documents into different vector spaces, whilst incorporating semantic
   word measures and natural language processing techniques. The ensemble
   model built in this study, shows a significantly higher accuracy level,
   which indeed proves the need for incorporation of domain specific
   semantic similarity measures into the information retrieval process.
   This study also shows, the impact of varying distribution of the word
   similarity measures, against varying document vector dimensions, which
   can lead to improvements in the process of legal information retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{One general method to gather documents for a specific topic is to
   generate a good query for the topic and then to gather documents related
   to the query at the word level. However, this method has a critical
   problem that it accompanies some noisy documents which are irrelevant to
   the topic since it does not consider the semantics of documents.
   Therefore, in order to incorporate document semantics into document
   gathering, this paper proposes a novel method that determines whether
   each document gathered in the way explained above is a noise or not by
   matching the topic distributions. The experimental results on web
   documents proves the plausibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Textual information found in scene images provides high level semantic
   information about the image and its context and it can be leveraged for
   better scene understanding. In this paper we address the problem of
   scene text retrieval: given a text query, the system must return all
   images containing the queried text. The novelty of the proposed model
   consists in the usage of a single shot CNN architecture that predicts at
   the same time bounding boxes and a compact text representation of the
   words in them. In this way, the text based image retrieval task can be
   casted as a simple nearest neighbor search of the query text
   representation over the outputs of the CNN over the entire image
   database. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture
   outperforms previous state-of-the-art while it offers a significant
   increase in processing speed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the controlled vocabulary for documents indexing makes it
   possible to index documents with other terms not present in the

   favoring the partial matching. In this paper we propose an Information
   Retrieval Approach based on Indexing Text Documents which combine two
   methods statistical and semantic one. A measure of similarity is then
   considered to measure the correspondence between a document and term in
   MESH thesaurus. To filter the extracted concepts and keep the relevant

   proposed approach is implemented to evaluate its effectiveness and the

Abstract = {{Top-k document retrieval, which returns highly relevant documents
   relative to a query, is an essential task for many applications. One of
   the promising index frameworks is built by FM-index and wavelet tree for
   supporting efficient top-k document retrieval. The index, however, has
   difficulty on handling document frequency (DF) at search time because
   indexed terms are all substrings of a document collection. Previous
   works exhaustively search all the parts of the index, where most of the
   documents are not relevant, for DF calculation or store precalculated DF
   values in huge additional space. In this paper, we propose two methods
   to approximate DF of a query term by exploiting the information obtained
   from the process of traversing the index structures. Experimental
   results showed that our methods achieved almost equal effectiveness of
   exhaustive search while keeping search efficiency that time of our
   methods are about a half of the exhaustive search.}},

Abstract = {{Given a short event name, event retrieval is a process of retrieving
   event related documents from a document collection. The existing
   approaches employ the-state-of-art retrieval models to retrieve relevant
   documents, however, these methods only regard the input query as several
   keywords instead of an event, thus the special aspects of the event are
   not considered in the models. Aiming at this problem, we first propose a
   novel bipartite graph model to describe an event, where one bipartition
   represents event type and the other represents the event specific
   information. Each edge between two bipartitions issues co-occurrence
   relationship. Then we model an event with a unigram language model
   estimated through the corresponding bipartite graph. Based on
   KL-divergence retrieval framework, event model is integrated into the
   query model for more accurate query representation. Experiments on
   publicly available TREC datasets show that our method can improve the
   precision@N metric of event retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{We design algorithms that, given a collection of documents and a
   distribution over user queries, return a small subset of the document
   collection in such a way that we can efficiently provide high-quality
   answers to user queries using only the selected subset. This approach
   has applications when space is a constraint or when the query-processing
   time increases significantly with the size of the collection. We study
   our algorithms through the lens of stochastic analysis and prove that
   even though they use only a small fraction of the entire collection,
   they can provide answers to most user queries, achieving a performance
   close to the optimal. To complement our theoretical findings, we
   experimentally show the versatility of our approach by considering two
   important cases in the context of Web search. In the first case, we
   favor the retrieval of documents that are relevant to the query, whereas
   in the second case we aim for document diversification. Both the
   theoretical and the experimental analysis provide strong evidence of the
   potential value of query covering in diverse application scenarios.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},

Abstract = {{Modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems have become more and more
   complex, involving a large number of parameters. For example, a system
   may choose from a set of possible retrieval models (BM25, language
   model, etc.), or various query expansion parameters, whose values
   greatly influence the overall retrieval effectiveness. Traditionally,
   these parameters are set at a system level based on training queries,
   and the same parameters are then used for different queries. We observe
   that it may not be easy to set all these parameters separately, since
   they can be dependent. In addition, a global setting for all queries may
   not best fit all individual queries with different characteristics. The
   parameters should be set according to these characteristics. In this
   article, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem by dealing
   with the entire system configurations (i.e., a set of parameters
   representing an IR system behaviour) instead of selecting a single
   parameter at a time. The selection of the best configuration is cast as
   a problem of ranking different possible configurations given a query. We
   apply learning-to-rank approaches for this task. We exploit both the
   query features and the system configuration features in the
   learning-to-rank method so that the selection of configuration is query
   dependent. The experiments we conducted on four TREC ad hoc collections
   show that this approach can significantly outperform the traditional
   method to tune system configuration globally (i.e., grid search) and
   leads to higher effectiveness than the top performing systems of the
   TREC tracks. We also perform an ablation analysis on the impact of
   different features on the model learning capability and show that query
   expansion features are among the most important for adaptive systems.}},

Abstract = {{Document retrieval plays a crucial role in retrieving relevant
   documents. Relevancy depends upon the occurrences of query keywords in a
   document. Several documents include a similar key terms and hence they
   need to be indexed. Most of the indexing techniques are either based on
   inverted index or full-text index. Inverted index create lists and
   support word-based pattern queries. While full-text index handle queries
   comprise of any sequence of characters rather than just words. Problems
   arise when text cannot be separated as words in some western languages.
   Also, there are difficulties in space used by compressed versions of
   full-text indexes. Recently, one of the unique data structure called
   wavelet tree has been popular in the text compression and indexing. It
   indexes words or characters of the text documents and help in retrieving
   top ranked documents more efficiently. This paper presents a review on
   most recent efficient indexing techniques used in document retrieval.}},

   Recently, a new promising metric called Word Mover's Distance was

   term-weighting schemes and provide more accurate and computationally
   efficient matching between documents using entropic regularization. We
   evaluate the benefits of both extensions in the task of cross-lingual

Abstract = {{The increasing incidence of depression has attracted increased attention
   to mental-health document retrieval techniques which aims to help
   individuals efficiently locate documents and resources relevant to their
   depressive problems. However, current retrieval systems generally have
   low accuracy. We propose combining a Valence-Arousal-based (VA-based)
   retrieval model and other word-based retrieval models to improve the
   precision of retrieval results. The VA-based retrieval model considers
   affective words extracted from queries, which help provide a better
   understanding of user queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   combined methods outperform the word-based retrieval models which adopt
   word-level information alone, such as vector space model and BM25 model.}},

Abstract = {{Spoken document retrieval (SDR) has become an important research subject
   due to the immenseness of multimedia data along with speech have spread
   around the world in our daily life. One of the fundamental challenge
   facing SDR is that the input query usually contains only a few words,
   which is too short to convey the information need of a user. In order to
   mitigate the problem, a well-practiced strategy is to reformulate the
   original query by performing a pseudo-relevance feedback process.
   Although several studies have evidenced its ability and capability for
   enhancing the retrieval performance, the time-consuming problem makes it
   hard to be used in reality. Motivated by the observations, in this
   paper, we concentrate on proposing a novel framework, which targets at
   generating a set of pseudo-relevant representations for a given query
   automatically, and eliminating the time-wasting problem. On top of the
   generated representations, we further investigate a novel query
   reformulation mechanism so as to improve the retrieval performance. A
   series of empirical SDR experiments conducted on a benchmark collection
   demonstrate the good efficacy of the proposed framework, compared to
   several existing strong baseline systems.}},

Abstract = {{Query paraphrasing aims to construct a better formulation of user
   queries in order to enhance retrieval. Formulating search queries
   remains complicated for a subset of Web users. In a typical situation, a
   user will not receive satisfactory results from the submitted search
   query and will subsequently attempt different query paraphrases. The
   Arabic vocabulary is rich in synonyms and hyponyms. Such richness of
   synonyms makes automation of the paraphrasing technique crucial for
   Arabic information retrieval systems in order to facilitate the process
   of paraphrasing synonyms. In this article, we propose an enhancement for
   Arabic information retrieval using a query paraphrasing technique.
   Furthermore, two query paraphrasing optimization techniques are proposed
   to overcome the time complexity and exhaustive calculation of existing
   query paraphrasing techniques. One of these techniques uses a genetic
   algorithm (GA-QP), and the other employs the artificial bee colony
   algorithm (ABC-QP). The performance of these two algorithms is compared.
   ABC-QP shows an improvement in Arabic information retrieval performance
   compared with the genetic algorithm query paraphrasing system.}},

Abstract = {{University support service strategy is to place customers at the center,
   which is a future insight that customers are the primary source for the
   growth. The rapid growth of text documents and organizing the data
   efficiently to support students, and other stakeholders of the
   organizations is a key challenge. We have built a text document search
   support system on High Performance Distributed Information System which
   resolves data handling and serve customers. In this paper, we describe
   the system architecture, data distribution technique and the retrieval
   system we have built. Text document classification is carried out using
   the convolutional neural network (CNN) for efficient retrieval and
   indexing of the data for crawling. The information is distributed and
   retrieved based on the identification key using an API based
   micro-service architecture. The system provides the platform to extract
   knowledge and channel the data to use by the organization and create
   on-demand service at the support centers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a high recall active document retrieval system
   for a class of applications involving query documents, as opposed to key
   terms, and domain-specific document corpora. The output of the model is
   a list of documents retrieved based on the domain expert feedback
   collected during training. A modified version of Bag of Word (BoW)
   representation and a semantic ranking module, based on Google n-grams,
   are used in the model. The core of the system is a binary document
   classification model which is trained through a continuous active
   learning strategy. In general, finding or constructing training data for
   this type of problem is very difficult due to either confidentiality of
   the data, or the need for domain expert time to label data. Our
   experimental results on the retrieval of Call For Papers based on a
   manuscript demonstrate the efficacy of the system to address this
   application and its performance compared to other candidate models.}},

Abstract = {{Information retrieval system is a system that is used to obtain the
   information based on user's requirement. In this study, Latent Semantic
   Indexing (LSI) method is implemented in the system to search and to
   collect documents based on overall meaning of documents instead of
   individual's word. Typical of documents that needs to be retrieved in
   the system are text document in {*}doc, {*}.docx, or {*}.pdf formatted.
   In the text preprocessing phase, Nazief and Adriani Algorithm is used to
   eliminate the affix (prefix, suffix, etc.) of a word and then match them
   in database root word. To evaluate the quality of information retrieval
   performance, time response, values of recall and precision are measured.
   Implementation of multithreading from `read document' to stemming
   process is required in order to improve time responses. The result shows
   by using multithreading, the greater number of term in document
   collection gives the more efficient in required time response. In term
   of the required time response, the document collection in docx format is
   the fastest, followed by doc and pdf format. For 80 documents and
   beyond, the system produces an error ``OutOfMemoryError{''} at the
   matrix decomposition process. This means that the greater number of
   document in the collection, the greater memory is needed to execute
   retrieval process.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. The use of averaged topic-level scores can result in the
   loss of valuable data and can cause misinterpretation of the
   effectiveness of system performance. This study aims to use the scores
   of each document to evaluate document retrieval systems in a pairwise
   system evaluation.
   Method. The chosen evaluation metrics are document-level precision
   scores against topic-level average precision (AP) scores, and
   document-level rank-biased precision scores against topic-level
   rank-biased precision at cut-off k (k=100) scores.
   Analysis. An analysis of the results of paired significance tests with
   the use of document-level and topic-level scores are compared to
   determine the agreement in the obtained numbers of statistically
   significant information retrieval system pairs.
   Results. The experiment results at document-level are an effective
   evaluation unit in the pairwise evaluation of information retrieval
   systems, with higher numbers of statistically significant (p=0.01)
   system pairs, compared with the topic-level results and a high
   percentage of statistically significant agreement with topic-level.
   Conclusion. This study presents an original viewpoint on measuring the
   effectiveness of document retrieval systems through pairwise evaluation
   by using document-level scores as a unit of evaluation in the
   significance testing instead of the traditional topic-level scores
   (which involve averaging document scores).}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has evident potential for enriching the
   representation of short queries. Traditional PRF methods treat
   top-ranked documents as feedback, since they are assumed to be relevant
   to the query. However, some of these feedback documents may actually
   distract from the query topic for a range of reasons and accordingly
   downgrade PRF system performance. Such documents constitute negative
   examples (negative feedback) but could also be valuable in retrieval. In
   this paper, a novel framework of query language model construction is
   proposed in order to improve retrieval performance by integrating both
   positive and negative feedback. First, an improvement-based method is
   proposed to automatically identify the types of feedback documents (i.e.
   positive or negative) according to whether the document enhances the
   retrieval's effectiveness. Subsequently, based on the learned positive
   and negative examples, the positive feedback models and the negative
   feedback models are estimated using an Expectation-Maximization
   algorithm with the assumptions: the positive term distribution is
   affected by the context term distribution and the negative term
   distribution is affected by both the positive term distribution and the
   context term distribution (such that the positive feedback model
   upgrades the rankings of relevant documents and the negative feedback
   model prunes the irrelevant documents from a query). Finally, a
   content-based representativeness criterion is proposed in order to
   obtain the representative negative feedback documents. Experiments
   conducted on the TREC collections demonstrate that our proposed approach
   results in better retrieval accuracy and robustness than baseline
   methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of ad-hoc structured document retrieval arises in many
   information access scenarios, from Web to product search. Yet neither
   deep neural networks, which have been successfully applied to ad-hoc
   information retrieval and Web search, nor the attention mechanism, which
   has been shown to significantly improve the performance of deep neural
   networks on natural language processing tasks, have been explored in the
   context of this problem. In this paper, we propose a deep neural
   architecture for ad-hoc structured document retrieval, which utilizes
   attention mechanism to determine important phrases in keyword queries as
   well as the relative importance of matching those phrases in different
   fields of structured documents. Experimental evaluation on publicly
   available collections for Web document, product and entity retrieval
   from knowledge graphs indicates superior retrieval accuracy of the
   proposed neural architecture relative to both state-of-the-art neural
   architectures for ad-hoc document retrieval and probabilistic models for

Abstract = {{One of the important challenges in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is the
   efficient and accurate resource discovery. To address this problem, this
   paper proposes an ontology-based search model for document retrieval in
   P2P networks. The model provides a gobal shared peer ontology to
   represent and manage the peers' knowledge, and gives the query
   expression against the peers' knowledge base. Furthermore, it uses a

Abstract = {{With the increasing availability of spoken documents in different
   languages, there is a need of systems performing automatic and
   unsupervised search on audio streams, containing speech, in a document
   retrieval scenario. We are interested in retrieving information from
   multilingual speech data, from spoken documents such as broadcast news,
   video archives or even telephone conversations. The ultimate goal of a
   Spoken Document Retrieval System is to enable vocabulary-independent
   search over large collections of speech content, to find written or
   spoken ``queries{''} or reoccurring speech data. If the language is
   known, the task is relatively simple. One could use a large vocabulary
   continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tool to produce highly accurate
   word transcripts, which are then indexed and query terms are retrieved
   from the index. However, if the language is unknown, hence queries are
   not part of the recognizer`s vocabulary, the relevant audio documents
   cannot be retrieved. Thus, search metrics are affected, and documents
   retrieved are no longer relevant to the user. In this paper we
   investigate whether the use of input features derived from
   multi-language resources helps the process of unsupervised spoken term
   detection, independent of the language. Moreover, we explore the use of
   multi objective search, by combining both language detection and LVCSR
   based search, with unsupervised Spoken Term Detection (STD). In order to
   achieve this, we make use of multiple open-source tools and in-house
   acoustic and language models, to propose a language independent spoken
   document retrieval system.}},

Abstract = {{Spoken document retrieval (SDR) is becoming a much-needed application
   due to that unprecedented volumes of audio-visual media have been made
   available in our daily life. As far as we are aware, most of the wide
   variety of SDR methods mainly focus on exploring robust indexing and
   effective retrieval methods to quantify the relevance degree between a
   pair of query and document. However, similar to information retrieval
   (IR), a fundamental challenge facing SDR is that a query is usually too
   short to convey a user's information need, such that a retrieval system
   cannot always achieve prospective efficacy when with the existing
   retrieval methods. In order to further boost retrieval performance,
   several studies turn their attention to reformulating the original query
   by leveraging an online pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) process, which
   often comes at the price of taking significant time. Motivated by these
   observations, this paper presents a novel extension of the general line
   of SDR research and its contribution is at least two-fold. First,
   building on neural network-based techniques, we put forward a neural
   relevance-aware query modeling (NRM) framework, which is designed to not
   only infer a discriminative query language model automatically for a
   given query, but also get around the time-consuming PRF process. Second,
   the utility of the methods instantiated from our proposed framework and
   several widely-used retrieval methods are extensively analyzed and
   compared on a standard SDR task, which suggests the superiority of our
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptographic cloud storage is used to make optimal use of the cloud
   storage infrastructure to outsource sensitive and mission-critical data.
   The continuous growth of encrypted data outsourced to cloud storage
   requires continuous updating. Attacks like file-injection are reported
   to compromise confidentiality of the user as a consequence of
   information leakage during update. It is required that dynamic schemes
   provide forward privacy guarantees. Updates should not leak information
   to the untrusted server regarding the previously issued queries.
   Therefore, the challenge is to design an efficient searchable encryption
   scheme with dynamic updates and forward privacy guarantees. In this
   paper, a novel private multi-linked dynamic index for encrypted document
   retrieval namely Pindex is proposed. The multi-linked dynamic index is
   constructed using probabilistic homomorphic encryption mechanism and
   secret orthogonal vectors. Full security proofs for correctness and
   forward privacy in the random oracle model is provided. Experiments on
   real world Enron dataset demonstrates that our construction is practical
   and efficient. The security and performance analysis of Pindex shows
   that the dynamic multi-linked index guarantees forward privacy without
   significant loss of efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Given a document collection, Document Retrieval is the task of returning
   the most relevant documents for a specified user query. In this paper,
   we assess a document retrieval approach exploiting Linked Open Data and
   Knowledge Extraction techniques. Based on Natural Language Processing
   methods (e.g., Entity Linking, Frame Detection), knowledge extraction
   allows disambiguating the semantic content of queries and documents,
   linking it to established Linked Open Data resources (e.g., DBpedia,
   YAGO) from which additional semantic terms (entities, types, frames,
   temporal information) are imported to realize a semantic-based expansion
   of queries and documents. The approach, implemented in the KE4IR system,
   has been evaluated on different state-of-the-art datasets, on a total of
   555 queries and with document collections spanning from few hundreds to
   more than a million of documents. The results show that the expansion
   with semantic content extracted from queries and documents enables
   consistently outperforming retrieval performances when only textual
   information is exploited; on a specific dataset for semantic search,
   KE4IR outperforms a reference ontology-based search system. The
   experiments also validate the feasibility of applying knowledge
   extraction techniques for document retrieval - i.e., processing the
   document collection, building the expanded index, and searching over it
   - on large collections (e.g., TREC WT10g).}},

Abstract = {{Traditional statistical retrieval models often treat each document as a
   whole. In many cases, however, a document is relevant to a query only
   because a small part of it contain the targeted information. In this
   work, we propose a neural passage model (NPM) that uses passage-level
   information to improve the performance of ad-hoc retrieval. Instead of
   using a single window to extract passages, our model automatically
   learns to weight passages with different granularities in the training
   process. We show that the passage-based document ranking paradigm from
   previous studies can be directly derived from our neural framework.
   Also, our experiments on a TREC collection showed that the NPM can
   significantly outperform the existing passage-based retrieval models.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1080-1102}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This article extends relevance theory (RT) from linguistic pragmatics
   into information retrieval. Using more than 50 retrieval experiments
   from the literature as examples, it applies RT to explain the frequency
   distributions of documents on relevance scales with three or more
   points. The scale points, which judges in experiments must consider in
   addition to queries and documents, are communications from researchers.
   In RT, the relevance of a communication varies directly with its
   cognitive effects and inversely with the effort of processing it.
   Researchers define and/or label the scale points to measure the
   cognitive effects of documents on judges. However, they apparently
   assume that all scale points as presented are equally easy for judges to
   process. Yet the notion that points cost variable effort explains fairly
   well the frequency distributions of judgments across them. By
   hypothesis, points that cost more effort are chosen by judges less
   frequently. Effort varies with the vagueness or strictness of
   scale-point labels and definitions. It is shown that vague scales tend
   to produce U- or V-shaped distributions, while strict scales tend to
   produce right-skewed distributions. These results reinforce the paper's
   more general argument that RT clarifies the concept of relevance in the
   dialogues of retrieval evaluation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Learning to rank has recently emerged as an attractive technique
   dedicated to the optimization of results rankings and based on machine
   learning techniques. Several search engine applications are using this
   technique to train their ranking model. Theoretically, the problem of
   ranking is to predict an ordering over a set of pairs query-document.
   However, the enormously large size of the Web documents makes it
   generally impossible for the users to find their desired information by
   surfing the Web. As a consequence, effective and efficient information
   retrieval (IR) has become more important and also IR system (IRS) has
   become indispensable tool that can allow the user to access only to the
   information he deems relevant. Currently, we have proposed two pairwise
   learning to rank algorithms which combine active and semi-supervised
   learning to reduce the labeling effort for DR. In this paper, we propose
   to improve these semi-supervised active algorithms by using a list of
   pairs in selecting unlabeled data. We showed through different ranking
   measures that the algorithms proposed yielded into competitive results
   compared to SAL2R and ASSL2R on collections from the standard benchmark
   Letor.}},

Abstract = {{Information retrieval (IR) systems are designed, in general, to satisfy
   the information need of a user who expresses it by means of a query, by
   providing him with a subset of documents selected from a collection and

   IR models, which define how to represent the documents and the query, as
   well as how to determine the relevance of a document for a query. In
   this article, we present a new IR model based on concepts taken from
   both IR and digital signal processing (like Fourier analysis of signals
   and filtering). This allows the whole IR process to be seen as a
   physical phenomenon, where the query corresponds to a signal, the
   documents correspond to filters, and the determination of the relevant
   documents to the query is done by filtering that signal. Tests showed
   that the quality of the results provided by this IR model is comparable
   with the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{MEDLINE is a rapidly growing database; to utilize this resource,
   practitioners and biomedical researchers have dealt with tedious and
   time-consuming tasks such as discovering, searching, reading and
   evaluating of biomedical documents. However, making a label for a group
   of biomedical documents is expensive and needs a complicated operation.
   Otherwise, compound words, polysemous and synonymous problems can
   influence the search in MEDLINE. Therefore, designing an efficient way
   of sharing knowledge and information organization is essential so that
   information retrieval systems can provide ideal outcomes. For this
   purpose, different strategies are used in the retrieval of biomedical
   documents (RBD). However, still a number of unrelated results for the
   users' query are obtained in the RBD process. Studies have shown that
   well-defined clusters in the retrieval system exhibit a more efficient
   performance in contrast to the document-based retrieval. Accordingly,
   the present study proposes the Expanding Statistical Language Modeling
   and Thesaurus (ESLMT) for clustering and retrieving biomedical
   documents. The results showed that Clustering with ESLM Similarity and
   Thesaurus (CESLMST) in all those criteria in this study have a higher
   value than the other compared methods. The results indicated that the
   mean average precision (MAP) has improved in the Clusters' Retrieval
   Derived from ESLM Similarity-Query (CRDESLMS-QET) method in comparison
   to the previous methods with the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) data
   set.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a semantic indexing and document retrieval approach
   for personalized language modeling to improve speech recognition
   accuracy for individual speakers in a lecture speech transcription task.
   The latent semantic indexing and paragraph vector modeling are
   implemented to retrieve a subset of documents from an existing
   background corpus relevant to the topic and speaking style of a speaker.
   We select a subset of text documents semantically similar to the output
   hypotheses from recognized speech segments in the first decoding stage.
   After that, a small user topic-specific language model is created from
   the relevant documents, interpolated with the background model, adapted
   to the current topic and applied during the second decoding stage.
   Experimental results performed for ten speakers from the database of the
   Slovak TEDx talks show an improvement in word error rate up to 3.03\%

   has recently achieved record-breaking success on many natural language

   (SDR). This paper adopts and extends BERT for SDR, while its
   contributions are at least three-fold. First, we augment BERT with extra
   language features such as unigram and inverse document frequency (IDF)
   statistics to make it more applicable to SDR. Second, we also explore
   the incorporation of confidence scores into document representations to
   see if they could help alleviate the negative effects resulting from
   imperfect automatic speech recognition (ASR). Third, we conduct a
   comprehensive set of experiments to compare our BERT-based ranking
   methods with other state-of-the-art ones and investigate the synergy
   effect of them as well.}},

   speech have become available in our daily life. As far as we are aware,
   there has been relatively less work in launching unsupervised paragraph
   embedding methods and investigating the effectiveness of these methods
   on the SDR task. This paper first presents a novel paragraph embedding
   method, named the essence vector (EV) model, which aims at inferring a
   representation for a given paragraph by encapsulating the most
   representative information from the paragraph and excluding the general
   background information at the same time. On top of the EV model, we
   develop three query language modeling mechanisms to improve the
   retrieval performance. A series of empirical SDR experiments conducted
   on two benchmark collections demonstrate the good efficacy of the
   proposed framework, compared to several existing strong baseline
   systems.}},

   of a term in a document whereas LI Frequency (LIF) measures least
   information based on the probability of drawing a term from a bag of
   words. Experiments on four benchmark TREC collections for ad hoc
   retrieval showed that LIT-based methods achieved superior performances

Abstract = {{A huge range of corporations these days generate and proportionate
   textual descriptions of their products, services, and moves. Such
   collections of textual records contain widespread quantity of structured
   facts, which stays buried inside the unstructured text. Whilst records
   extraction algorithms facilitate the extraction of structured relations,
   they're often costly and faulty. In particular, while operating on top
   of textual content that doesn't include any instances of the centered
   structured data. In this paper, we present an unique alternative
   approach that facilitates the technology of the established metadata via
   identifying documents that are probable to comprise the records and this
   fact in the end will be beneficial for querying the database. Our
   technique is predicated on the idea that human beings those are more
   likely to feature the essential metadata all through creation time, if
   we bring it on by using an interface; or that it is a whole lot simpler
   for humans (and/or algorithms) to pick out the metadata while such
   statistics certainly exists in the documents. As a primary contribution
   of this paper, we are approaching the algorithms, those become aware of
   established attributes which can be probably to seem inside the report,
   by collectively utilizing the content material of the textual content
   and the query workload. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our
   method generates advanced effects compared to techniques that rely best
   on the textual content or best on the query workload, to pick out
   attributes of hobby.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we address the task of scene text retrieval: given a text
   query, the system returns all im-ages containing the queried text. The
   proposed model uses a single shot CNN architecture that predicts
   bounding boxes and builds a compact representation of spotted words. In
   this way, this problem can be modeled as a nearest neighbor search of
   the textual representation of a query over the outputs of the CNN
   collected from the totality of an image database. Our experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous
   state-of-the-art, while offering a significant increase in processing
   speed and unmatched expressiveness with samples never seen at training
   time. Several experiments to assess the generalization capability of the
   model are conducted in a multilingual dataset, as well as an application
   of real-time text spotting in videos. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Events are an integral part of our day-to-day search needs. Users search
   for various kinds of events such as political events, organizational
   announcements, policy changes, personal events, criminal activity and so
   on. In linguistics, events are often thought of as discourse entities
   with associated complex structure and attributes.
   Many professionals look for patterns that involve event occurrences.
   Journalists, financial analysts, intelligence analysts, attorneys
   conducting investigations, auditors examining corporate records are
   examples of users who may want to find such information and to arrange
   it in ways that can help to produce meaningful analyses.
   The goal of this work is to develop effective information retrieval
   systems that can help users to satisfy event-related information needs.
   My particular interest is in events that are decomposable into subevents
   in ways that can be anticipated. I am interested in modeling
   decomposable events, and in automatically recognizing references to
   subevents, both to help with finding relevant documents and to help with
   presenting diverse results to the user.
   I plan to pursue this broader goal in three stages, each of which
   involves creating a test collection. I have started by developing
   information retrieval test collections for news, building on existing
   collections of news stories from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC)
   {[}4] and the Topic Detection and Tracking Evaluations {[}1]. Next, I
   plan to build a new event ontology for email, and use that ontology as a
   basis for building an information retrieval collection from the Avocado
   Email collection. Finally, I plan to extend one or both of these test
   collections to support research on characterizing event impact, thus
   perhaps providing an additional basis for ranking.
   In each stage of my work, new test collection(s) will enable new
   research. In my first stage, which is in progress, I have studied the
   effect of automatically detected subevents on ranking effectiveness.
   Using the Rich Entities, Relations and Events (ERE) ontology of event
   types and subtypes from the TAC Event track {[}5], and two existing
   automated event detection systems, I have developed a simple bag of
   words-and-events search system that uses the automatically detected
   event type information. I also built an information retrieval test
   collection from a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) collection, for
   which event-based topics exist. Evaluation results show promise when
   compared to baseline approaches. I plan to further develop this line of
   work to identify ways to automatically decompose high level events into
   their components.
   With the goal of extending the event retrieval work to an organizational
   setting, in my second line of research I plan to work with the Avocado
   email collection {[}3]. While newswire text and other Web pages are
   easily available for everyone's perusal, email content is interesting
   because it may contain organizational and personal events that differ
   from those found in news, and those events may be referred to in less
   fully contextualized ways. In this line of research, I want to build a
   retrieval system for events in this genre of personal and organizational
   content. The retrieval system will provide a diverse ranking covering
   the full range of subevents for which information is available. To do
   this, I will need a reusable test collection containing event-related
   topics, with the event nuggets within those documents annotated for
   relevance. This annotation at the event nugget level will support
   computing measures like alpha-nDCG {[}2] in which the gain reflects in
   part the number of different event nuggets in a document.
   The third stage of my work will be more exploratory, since there are
   many ways in which one might conceptualize event impact. My initial
   approach will be to explore alternative indicators for different types
   of impact. For example, the societal impact of news stories might be
   characterized by the number of readers, whereas the personal impact of
   an email might be characterized by the time before a reply is received.
   I am particularly interested in how sentiment analysis might be used to
   characterize event impact, particularly with reference to publicly
   available user-generated content.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the advantages of deep learning model in the extraction of
   abstract concept, a new text clustering algorithm is designed based on
   Deep Boltzmann Machines. Based on Replicate Softmax Model and new Deep
   Boltzmann Machine, energy function of this model is proposed and the
   detail learning algorithm is introduced. The learning can be made more
   efficient by using a layer-by-layer ``pre-training{''} phase that allows
   variation inference to be initialized with a single bottom up pass. The
   values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer
   and give a much better representation of each document than low
   learning. The 20-newsgroups document sets experiment results illustrated
   that the novel algorithm learn good generative models, get the better

Abstract = {{Discriminative learning algorithms such as logistic regression excel
   when training data are plentiful, but falter when it is meager. An
   extreme case is text retrieval (zero training data), where
   discriminative learning is impossible and heuristics such as BM25, which
   combine domain knowledge (a topical keyword query) with generative
   learning (Naive Bayes), are dominant. Building on past work, we show
   that BM25-inspired Gaussian priors for Bayesian logistic regression
   based on topical keywords provide better effectiveness than the usual L2
   (zero mode, uniform variance) Gaussian prior. On two high recall
   retrieval datasets, the resulting models transition smoothly from BM25
   level effectiveness to discriminative effectiveness as training data
   volume increases, dominating L2 regularization even when substantial
   training data is available.}},

Abstract = {{Social annotations are valuable resources generated by users on the Web,
   which encode abundant information on user preferences for certain
   documents. Social annotation-based information retrieval has been
   studied in recent years for personalizing search results and fulfilling
   user information needs. However, since social annotations are
   complicated and associated with users, documents and tags
   simultaneously, it remains a great challenge to fully capture the
   potentially useful information for improving retrieval performance. To
   meet the challenge, we propose a novel method to integrate social
   annotations into topic models for personalized document retrieval. Our
   method first reconstructs candidate documents for a given query using
   social tags of documents to capture user preferences. The reconstructed
   documents are tailored to user preferences for achieving better
   performance. We then generalize the latent Dirichlet allocation-based
   topic models by considering the relationship among users, social tags
   and documents from social annotations. The modified topic model
   optimizes the distribution of latent topics of documents for different
   users to meet user information needs. Experimental results show that our
   method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline models
   for improving the performance of personalized retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Query-by-example spoken document retrieval (QbESDR) consists in, given a
   collection of documents, computing how likely a spoken query is present
   in each document. This is usually done by means of pattern matching
   techniques based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which leads to
   acceptable results but is inefficient in terms of query processing time.
   In this paper, the use of probabilistic retrieval models for information
   retrieval is applied to the QbESDR scenario. First, each document is
   represented by means of a language model, as commonly done in
   information retrieval, obtained by estimating the probability of the
   different n-grams extracted from automatic phone transcriptions of the
   documents. Then, the score of a query given a document can be computed
   following the query likelihood retrieval model. Besides the adaptation
   of this model to QbESDR, this paper presents two techniques that aim at
   enhancing the performance of this method. One of them consists in
   improving the language models of the documents by using several phone
   transcription hypotheses for each document. The other approach aims at
   re-ranking the retrieved documents by incorporating positional
   information to the system, which is achieved by string alignment of the
   query and document phone transcriptions. Experiments were performed on
   two large and heterogeneous datasets specifically designed for search on
   speech tasks, namely MediaEval 2013 Spoken Web Search (SWS 2013) and
   MediaEval 2014 Query-by-Example Search on Speech (QUESST 2014). The
   experimental results prove the validity of the proposed strategies for
   QbESDR. In addition, the performance when dealing with queries with word
   reorderings is superior to that exhibited by a DTW-based strategy, and
   the query processing time is smaller by several orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Spoken document retrieval (SDR) has long been deemed a fundamental and
   important step towards efficient organization of, and access to
   multimedia associated with spoken content. In this paper, we present a
   novel study of SDR leveraging the Bidirectional Encoder Representations
   from Transformers (BERT) model for query and document representations
   (embeddings), as well as for relevance scoring. BERT has produced
   extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language
   understanding, but relatively little research on it is devoted to text
   information retrieval (IR), let alone SDR. We further tackle one of the
   critical problems facing SDR, viz. a query is often too short to convey
   a user's information need, via the process of pseudo-relevance feedback
   (PRF), showing how information cues induced from PRF can be aptly
   incorporated into BERT for query expansion. In addition, such query
   reformulation through PRF also works in conjunction with additional
   augmentation of lexical features and confidence scores into the document
   embeddings learned from BERT. The merits of our approach are attested
   through extensive sets of experiments, which compare it with several
   classic and cutting-edge (deep learning-based) retrieval approaches.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{65-75}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The semantic information in any document collection is critical for
   query understanding in information retrieval. Existing concept
   lattice-based retrieval systems mainly rely on the partial order
   relation of formal concepts to index documents. However, the methods
   used by these systems often ignore the explicit semantic information
   between the formal concepts extracted from the collection. In this
   paper, a concept coupling relationship analysis model is proposed to
   learn and aggregate the intra- and inter-concept coupling relationships.
   The intra-concept coupling relationship employs the common terms of
   formal concepts to describe the explicit semantics of formal concepts.
   The inter-concept coupling relationship adopts the partial order
   relation of formal concepts to capture the implicit dependency of formal
   concepts. Based on the concept coupling relationship analysis model, we
   propose a concept lattice-based retrieval framework. This framework
   represents user queries and documents in a concept space based on fuzzy
   formal concept analysis, utilizes a concept lattice as a semantic index
   to organize documents, and ranks documents with respect to the learned
   concept coupling relationships. Experiments are performed on the text
   collections acquired from the SMART information retrieval system.
   Compared with classic concept lattice-based retrieval methods, our
   proposed method achieves at least 9\%, 8\% and 15\% improvement in terms
   of average MAP, IAP@11 and P@10 respectively on all the collections. (C)

Abstract = {{Since engineering design is heavily informational, engineers want to
   retrieve existing engineering documents accurately during the product
   development process. However, engineers have difficulties searching for
   documents because of low retrieval accuracy. One of the reasons for this
   is the limitation of existing document ranking approaches, in which
   relationships between terms in documents are not considered to assess
   the relevance of the retrieved documents. Therefore, we propose a new
   ranking approach that provides more correct evaluation of document
   relevance to a given query. Our approach exploits domain ontology to
   consider relationships among terms in the relevance scoring process.
   Based on domain ontology, the semantics of a document are represented by
   a graph (called Document Semantic Network) and, then, proposed
   relation-based weighting schemes are used to evaluate the graph to
   calculate the document relevance score. In our ranking approach, user
   interests and searching intent are also considered in order to provide
   personalized services. The experimental results show that the proposed
   approach outperforms existing ranking approaches. A precisely
   represented semantics of a document as a graph and multiple
   relation-based weighting schemes are important factors underlying the
   notable improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An approach for document retrieval using cluster-based inverted indexing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Document retrieval plays an important role in knowledge management as it
   facilitates us to discover the relevant information from the existing
   data. This article proposes a cluster-based inverted indexing algorithm
   for document retrieval. First, the pre-processing is done to remove the
   unnecessary and redundant words from the documents. Then, the indexing
   of documents is done by the cluster-based inverted indexing algorithm,
   which is developed by integrating the piecewise fuzzy C-means (piFCM)
   clustering algorithm and inverted indexing. After providing the index to
   the documents, the query matching is performed for the user queries
   using the Bhattacharyya distance. Finally, the query optimisation is
   done by the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the relevant documents
   are retrieved. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analysed by
   the WebKB data set and Twenty Newsgroups data set. The analysis exposes
   that the proposed algorithm offers high performance with a precision of
   1, recall of 0.70 and F-measure of 0.8235. The proposed document
   retrieval system retrieves the most relevant documents and speeds up the

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, topic modeling is gaining significant momentum in
   information retrieval (IR). Researchers have found that utilizing the
   topic information generated through topic modeling together with
   traditional TF-IDF information generates superior results in document
   retrieval. However, in order to apply this idea to real-life IR systems,
   some critical problems need to be solved: how to store the topic
   information and how to utilize it with the TF-IDF information for
   efficient document retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Topic
   Enhanced Inverted Index (TEII) to incorporate the topic information into
   the inverted index for efficient top-k document retrieval. Specifically,
   we explore two different types of TEIIs. We first propose the
   incremental TEII, which includes the topic information into the
   traditional inverted index by adding topic-based inverted lists. The
   incremental TEII is beneficial for legacy IR systems, since it does not
   change the existing TF-IDF-based inverted lists. As a more flexible
   alternative, we propose the hybrid TEII to incorporate the topic
   information into each posting of the inverted index. In the hybrid TEII,
   two relaxation methods are proposed to support dynamic estimation of the
   upper bound impact of each posting. The hybrid TEII is highly extensible
   for incorporating different ranking factors and we show an extension of
   the hybrid TEII by considering the static quality of the documents in
   the corpus. Based on the incremental and hybrid TEIIs, we develop
   several query processing algorithms to support efficient top-k document
   retrieval on TEIIs. Empirical evaluation on the TREC dataset verifies
   the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed index structures and
   query processing algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a domain specific Information Retrieval (IR)
   system that identifies query and document topics and use them for better
   documents retrieval. We focus on retrieving documents having the
   specific types of information as that of the user query related to the
   tourism domain. Based on our past experience in handling tourism
   specific information, we observed that the query intent in the tourism
   domain largely span over a few major types. Based on this observation,
   we present an approach for document retrieval based on query and
   documents type identification. To do this, we have identified the major
   types (topics) in the tourism domain and built an ontology of the
   tourism domain. We developed a document classifier to identify the topic
   of web documents, and a query classifier to identify the topic of the
   user query, both pertaining to the tourism domain. The proposed IR
   system performs document retrieval by matching the type of user query
   with the matching type of documents. The experimental results show that
   the tourism specific topic identification of queries and documents
   improves the retrieval of documents having more specific information to
   satisfy user queries in the tourism domain.}},

Abstract = {{Term mismatch is a serious problem effecting the performance of
   information retrieval systems. The problem is more severe in biomedical
   domain where lot of term variations, abbreviations and synonyms exist.
   We present query paraphrasing and various term selection combination
   techniques to overcome this problem. To perform paraphrasing, we use
   noun words to generate synonyms from Metathesaurus. The new synthesized
   paraphrases are ranked using statistical information derived from the
   corpus and relevant documents are retrieved based on top n selected
   paraphrases. We compare the results with state-of-the-art pseudo
   relevance feedback based retrieval techniques. In quest of enhancing the
   results of pseudo relevance feedback approach, we introduce two term
   selection combination techniques namely Borda Count and Intersection.
   Surprisingly, combinational techniques performed worse than single term
   selection techniques. In pseudo relevance feedback approach best
   algorithms are IG, Rochio and KLD which are performing 33\%, 30\% and
   20\% better than other techniques respectively. However, the performance
   of paraphrasing technique is 20\% better than pseudo relevance feedback
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{An Information Retrieval (IR) system aims to extract information based
   on a query made by a user on a particular subject from an extensive
   collection of text. IR is a process through which information is
   retrieved by submitting a query by a user in the form of keywords or to
   match words. In the Al-Quran, verses of the same or comparable topics
   are scattered throughout the text in different chapters, and it is
   therefore difficult for users to remember the many keywords of the
   verses. Therefore, in such situations, retrieving information using
   semantically related words is useful. In well-composed documents, the
   semantic integrity of the text (coherence) exists between the words.
   Lexical cohesion is the results of chains of related words that
   contribute to the continuity of the lexical meaning found within the
   text are a direct result of text being about the same thing (i.e. topic,
   etc.). This indicates that using an IR system and lexical chains are a
   useful and appropriate method for representing documents with concepts
   rather than using terms in order to have successful retrieval based on
   semantic relations. Therefore, a new Lexical Scoring System is proposed
   in this study, in addition to determining the semantic relation that
   exists between words whereby WordNet was used as the semantic knowledge
   base. The proposed scoring system helped to retrieve 86.58\% of the
   total relevant documents in the Al-Quran based on the relevance
   judgment, using the lexical chain approach. Based on the findings, the
   study concludes that, the proposed approach on representing verses using
   lexical chains is appropriate and suitable for a Quranic IR system.}},

Abstract = {{Document retrieval (DR) forms an important component in end-to-end
   question-answering (QA) systems where particular answers are sought for
   well-formed questions. DR in the QA scenario is also useful by itself
   even without a more involved natural language processing component to
   extract exact answers from the retrieved documents. This latter step may
   simply be done by humans like in traditional search engines granted the
   retrieved documents contain the answer. In this paper, we take advantage
   of datasets made available through the BioASQ end-to-end QA shared task
   series and build an effective biomedical DR system that relies on
   relevant answer snippets in the BioASQ training datasets. At the core of
   our approach is a question-answer sentence matching neural network that
   learns a measure of relevance of a sentence to an input question in the
   form of a matching score. In addition to this matching score feature, we
   also exploit two auxiliary features for scoring document relevance: the
   name of the journal in which a document is published and the
   presence/absence of semantic relations (subject-predicate-object
   triples) in a candidate answer sentence connecting entities mentioned in
   the question. We rerank our baseline sequential dependence model scores
   using these three additional features weighted via adaptive random
   research and other learning-to-rank methods. Our full system placed 2nd
   in the final batch of Phase A (DR) of task B (QA) in BioASQ 2018. Our
   ablation experiments highlight the significance of the neural matching
   network component in the full system.}},

Abstract = {{The Arabic index term selection is a challenging process due to the
   complex morphological nature of the Arabic language. Index term
   selection is a significant factor that affects the efficiency of any
   information retrieval system. Many methods of index term selection were
   proposed in the literature. The majority of them were based on root
   extraction and stemming. Other proposals apply complex linguistic rules
   and machine learning tools. This paper proposes a simple index term
   selection method using some heuristics such that a representative subset
   of terms is selected to form the index. The proposed heuristics
   essentially select index terms from Arabic words having the prefix `AL'
   (definite words) as a basis. Besides, the proposed method selects new
   words according to any of the following heuristics: the words preceding
   or words succeeding definite terms, choosing words that follow some
   linking words and words following propositions in semi-sentences, and
   selecting words that represent named entities. The proposed heuristics
   were tested using the TREC-2001/2002 Arabic test collection. The results
   show the effectiveness of the proposed method since it outperforms
   selecting all terms stemmed by two well-known stemmers. For example,
   choosing definite words and words that represent named entities
   outperforms selecting all terms stemmed by the LIGHT10 stemmer according
   to the mean average precision by 8.4\% and at the same time decreases
   the index size by 27.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{Image-text retrieval task has been a popular research topic and attracts
   a growing interest due to it bridges computer vision and natural
   language processing communities and involves two different modalities.
   Although a lot of methods have made a great progress in image-text task,
   it remains challenging because of the difficulty to learn the
   correspondence between two heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
   propose a multi-level representation learning for image-text retrieval
   task, which utilizes semantic-level, structural-level and contextual
   information to improve the quality of visual and textual representation.
   To utilize semantic-level information, we firstly extract the nouns,
   adjectives and number with high frequency as the semantic labels and
   adopt multi-label convolutional neural network framework to encode the
   semantic-level information. To explore the structure-level information
   of image-text pair, we firstly construct two graphs to encode the visual
   and textual information with respect to the corresponding modality and
   then, we apply graph matching with triplet loss to reduce the
   cross-modality discrepancy. To further improve the retrieval results, we
   utilize the contextual-level information from two modalities to refine
   the rank list and enhance the retrieval quality. Extensive experiments
   on Flickr30k and MSCOCO, which are two commonly datasets for image-text
   retrieval, have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{As a typical cross-modal problem, image-text bidirectional retrieval
   relies heavily on the joint embedding learning and similarity measure
   for each image-text pair. It remains challenging because prior works
   seldom explore semantic correspondences between modalities and semantic
   correlations in a single modality at the same time. In this work, we
   propose a unified Context-Aware Attention Network (CAAN), which
   selectively focuses on critical local fragments (regions and words) by
   aggregating the global context. Specifically, it simultaneously utilizes
   global inter-modal alignments and intra-modal correlations to discover
   latent semantic relations. Considering the interactions between images
   and sentences in the retrieval process, intra-modal correlations are
   derived from the second-order attention of region-word alignments
   instead of intuitively comparing the distance between original features.
   Our method achieves fairly competitive results on two generic image-text
   retrieval datasets Flickr30K and MS-COCO.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-modal image-text retrieval has been a long-standing challenge in
   the multimedia community. Existing methods explore various complicated
   embedding spaces to assess the semantic similarity between a given
   image-text pair, but consider no/little about the consistency across
   them. To remedy this situation, we introduce the idea of semantic
   consistency for learning various embedding spaces jointly. Specifically,
   similar to the previous works, we start by constructing two different
   embedding spaces, namely the image-grounded embedding space and the
   text-grounded embedding space. However, instead of learning these two
   embedding spaces separately, we incorporate a semantic consistency
   constraint in the common ranking objective function such that both
   embedding spaces can be learned simultaneously and benefit from each
   other to gain performance improvement. We conduct extensive experiments
   on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.
   Results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on
   all three datasets, which can well demonstrate the effectiveness and
   superiority of the introduction of semantic consistency. Our source code
   is released at: https://github.com/HuiChen24/SemanticConsistency.}},

Abstract = {{Information retrieval from documentary heritage is considered a
   challenging issue because of the documents' unique structures and level
   of degradation. Text characters in printed documents historically are
   accompanied by typographical objects. Retrieving and pursuing these
   visual typographical elements, which inform the content of historical
   manuscripts can help us better understand our documentary cultural
   heritage. Extracting these visual objects aids us in understanding and
   conveying more information about different practices of representation
   in historical documents and their effects on the current trends of
   publishing. Two important typographical objects related to the history
   of knowledge and information are footnotes and tables; the former are
   one of the critical elements that demonstrate authority and link the
   manuscript to its sources, and the latter summarize information in a
   compact and organized manner essential to the growth of scientific
   knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that
   considers in depth the automated detection of these two typographical
   objects from the large collections of historical documents that would
   allow further historical study. This article focuses on the problem of
   detecting the presence of these two visual elements from historical
   printed documents and establishes two frameworks. The footnote detection
   framework uses a set of layout-based methods to extract some features
   regarding the font and appearance, and the table detection framework
   extracts spectral-based features from the images. These frameworks are
   tested on a large collection of 18th-century printed documents with more
   than 32 million images, and the results show their effectiveness and
   generalization power. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of World Wide Web has extended Information Retrieval
   related technology such as queries for information needs become more
   easily accessible. One such platform is online question answering (QA).
   Online community can posting questions and get direct response for their
   special information needs using various platforms. It creates large
   unorganized repositories of valuable knowledge resources. Effective QA
   retrieval is required to make these repositories accessible to fulfill
   users information requests quickly. The repositories might contained
   similar questions and answer to users newly asked question. This paper
   explores the similarity-based models for the QA system to rank search
   result candidates. We used Damerau-Levenshtein distance and cosine
   similarity model to obtain ranking scores between the question posted by
   the registered user and a similar candidate questions in repository.
   Empirical experimental results indicate that our proposed ensemble
   models are very encouraging and give a significantly better similarity

Abstract = {{The word embedding models are capable of capturing the semantic content
   of the textual words. The process of extracting a set of word embedding
   vectors from a text document is similar to the feature extraction step
   of the Bag-of-Features pipeline, which is usually used in computer
   vision tasks. That gives rise to the Bag-of-Embedded Words (BoEW) model.
   In this paper a novel learning technique that optimizes both the word
   embedding and the codebook of the BoEW model towards text retrieval is
   proposed. The proposed method adheres to the cluster hypothesis that
   states that points in the same cluster are likely to fulfill the same
   information need and it is demonstrated, using two text datasets, that
   can significantly increase the retrieval precision. Finally, the
   proposed technique uses smaller representations than the competitive
   representation methods, that allows to reduce both the retrieval time
   and the storage requirements.}},

Abstract = {{With crimes increasing at an alarming rate, it becomes essential to
   impart justice to the victims readily. To come to a final decision,
   lawyers need to study several previous judgments for research purposes.
   Reducing the time spent on research can speed up the judicial process
   drastically. The time consumption mostly happens in two areas -
   searching for the right document and understanding that document. To
   start with, being able to get hold of the appropriate judgments or other
   legal documents is the most essential task for any legal professional,
   especially lawyers. Once a document is obtained, the next most integral
   and inevitable task is to read and re-read it, and come to necessary as
   well as needful conclusions after a comprehensive analysis. To resolve
   the first issue, there is a need for an efficient search system which
   can provide searching options based upon multiple views. This system is
   an effort at improving the search for users by providing them with
   search options based upon either the semantics of the word or based upon
   the IPC sections. It is important that laymen can access all the related
   judgments by entering just one keyword or phrase without bothering about
   the legal jargon. Post retrieval of documents, the lengthy texts have to
   be scrutinized for meaningful inferences. To reduce the time spent in
   reading texts, we intend to present the information in the judgments
   visually through semantic networks. Lawyers will be benefitted by this
   system because it will enable them to skip the complexity of the often
   verbose language of the legal documents. This IR System provides the
   features of semantic and IPC section based search to users, deriving
   information from semantic networks that are representative of the
   documents, so that a more efficient search system on legal documents can
   be put in place.}},

   selective search is used to find text regions. These regions are indexed
   per character n-grams present in the text region. An attribute
   representation based on Pyramidal Histogram of Characters (PHOC) is used
   to compare text regions with the query text. For generation of the index
   a similar attribute space based Pyramidal Histogram of character n-grams
   is used. These attribute models are learned using linear SVMs over the
   Fisher Vector {[}1] representation of the images along with the PHOC
   labels of the corresponding strings.}},

Abstract = {{Users of the WWW across the globe are increasing rapidly. According to
   Internet live stats there are more than 3 billion Internet users
   worldwide today and the number of non-English native speakers is quite
   high there. A large proportion of these non-English speakers access the
   Internet in their native languages but use the Roman script to express
   themselves through various communication channels like messages and
   posts. With the advent of Web 2.0, user-generated content is increasing
   on the Web at a very rapid rate. A substantial proportion of this
   content is transliterated data. To leverage this huge information
   repository, there is a matching effort to process transliterated text.
   In this article, we survey the recent body of work in the field of
   transliteration. We start with a definition and discussion of the
   different types of transliteration followed by various deterministic and
   non-deterministic approaches used to tackle transliteration-related
   issues in machine translation and information retrieval. Finally, we
   study the performance of those techniques and present a comparative
   analysis of them.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning approach for cross-modal
   image-text retrieval. First, a correlation network is proposed for
   relation recognition task, which helps learn the complicated relations
   and common information of different modalities. Then, we propose a
   correspondence cross-modal autoencoder for cross-modal input
   reconstruction task, which helps correlate the hidden representations of
   two uni-modal autoencoders. In addition, to further improve the
   performance of cross-modal retrieval, two regularization terms (variance
   and consistency constraints) are introduced to the cross-modal
   embeddings such that the learned common information has large variance
   and is modality invariant. Finally, to enable large-scale cross-modal
   similarity search, a flexible binary transform network is designed to
   convert the text and image embeddings into binary codes. Extensive
   experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model has
   robust superiority over the compared strong baseline methods.}},

Abstract = {{Myanmar word segmentation is an important task for construction of
   dictionary file for Myanmar information retrieval and Myanmar text
   compression. Although Myanmar word segmentation using dictionary and
   orthography has been existed for Myanmar language, the performance of
   word segmentation depends on the coverage of the dictionary and training
   dataset and can cause out of vocabulary (OOV) problem, leading to lower
   precision and recall in information retrieval. And to compress Myanmar
   text, words in text needs to be recognized first. In this paper, we
   propose a new method for Myanmar word segmentation by local statistical
   dataset without the use of any additional data (e.g., training corpus)
   and new compressed Myanmar Information Retrieval (MIR) model which used
   End Tagged Dense Code (ETDC) text compressed method. The experimental
   results showed that the method can improve evaluation of vocabulary file
   with precision 75\%, recall 87\%, F-measure 80\% and average compression
   ratio is 32\% of texts for Myanmar language.}},

Title = {{A decision support system for automating document retrieval and citation
   screening}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{182}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The systematic literature review (SLR) process includes several steps to
   collect secondary data and analyze it to answer research questions. In
   this context, the document retrieval and primary study selection steps
   are heavily intertwined and known for their repetitiveness, high human
   workload, and difficulty identifying all relevant literature. This study
   aims to reduce human workload and error of the document retrieval and
   primary study selection processes using a decision support system (DSS).
   An open-source DSS is proposed that supports the document retrieval
   step, dataset preprocessing, and citation classification. The DSS is
   domain-independent, as it has proven to carefully select an article's
   relevance based solely on the title and abstract. These features can be
   consistently retrieved from scientific database APIs. Additionally, the
   DSS is designed to run in the cloud without any required programming
   knowledge for reviewers. A Multi-Channel CNN architecture is implemented
   to support the citation screening process. With the provided DSS,
   reviewers can fill in their search strategy and manually label only a
   subset of the citations. The remaining unlabeled citations are
   automatically classified and sorted based on probability. It was shown
   that for four out of five review datasets, the DSS's use achieved
   significant workload savings of at least 10\%. The cross-validation
   results show that the system provides consistent results up to 88.3\% of
   work saved during citation screening. In two cases, our model yielded a
   better performance over the benchmark review datasets. As such, the
   proposed approach can assist the development of systematic literature
   reviews independent of the domain. The proposed DSS is effective and can
   substantially decrease the document retrieval and citation screening
   steps' workload and error rate.}},

   computation of a fuzzy median graph remains a computationally expensive
   task. In this paper, we propose a new approximate algorithm for the
   computation of the Fuzzy Generalized Median Graph (FGMG) based on Fuzzy
   Attributed Relational Graph (FARG) embedding in a suitable vector space
   in order to capture the maximum information in graphs and to improve the
   accuracy and speed of document image retrieval processing. In this
   study, we focus on the application of FGMGs to the Content-based
   Document Retrieval (CBDR) problem. Experiments on real and synthetic
   databases containing a large number of FARGs with large sizes show that
   a CBDR using the FGMG as a dataset representative yields better results
   than an exhaustive and sequential retrieval in terms of gains in
   accuracy and time processing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Resource Selection (or Query Routing) is an important step in P2P IR.
   Though analogous to document retrieval in the sense of choosing a
   relevant subset of resources, resource selection methods have evolved
   independently from those for document retrieval. Among the reasons for
   such divergence is that document retrieval targets scenarios where
   underlying resources are semantically homogeneous, whereas peers would
   manage diverse content. We observe that semantic heterogeneity is
   mitigated in the clustered 2-tier P2P IR architecture resource selection
   layer by way of usage of clustering, and posit that this necessitates a
   re-look at the applicability of document retrieval methods for resource
   selection within such a framework. This paper empirically benchmarks
   document retrieval models against the state-of-the-art resource
   selection models for the problem of resource selection in the clustered
   P2P IR architecture, using classical IR evaluation metrics. Our
   benchmarking study illustrates that document retrieval models
   significantly outperform other methods for the task of resource
   selection in the clustered P2P IR architecture. This indicates that
   clustered P2P IR framework can exploit advancements in document
   retrieval methods to deliver corresponding improvements in resource
   selection, indicating potential convergence of these fields for the
   clustered P2P IR architecture.}},

Abstract = {{An end-to-end architecture for multi-script document retrieval using

   signature components from all other components. A bag-of-visual-words
   powered by SIFT descriptors in a patch-based framework is proposed to
   compute the features and a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier
   was used to separate signatures from the documents. In the second stage,
   features from the foreground (i.e., signature strokes) and the
   background spatial information (i.e., background loops, reservoirs etc.)
   were combined to characterize the signature object to match with the
   query signature. Finally, three distance measures were used to match a
   query signature with the signature present in target documents for
   retrieval. The `Tobacco' (The Legacy Tobacco Document Library (LTDL).

Abstract = {{Robotic intelligence has recently received significant attention in the
   research community. Application of such artificial intelligence can be
   used to perform automatic document retrieval and interpretation by a
   robot through query. So, it is necessary to extract the key information
   from the document based on the query to produce the desired feedback.
   For this purpose, in this paper we propose a system for automatic date
   field extraction from multi-lingual (English, Devnagari and Bangla
   scripts) handwritten documents. The date is a key piece of information,
   which can be used in various robotic applications such as date-wise
   document indexing/retrieval. In order to design the system, first the
   script of the document is identified, and based on the identified
   script, word components of each text line are classified into month and
   non-month classes using word-level feature extraction and
   classification. Next, non-month words are segmented into individual
   components and labelled into one of text, digit, punctuation or
   contraction categories. Subsequently, the date patterns are searched
   using the labelled components. Both numeric and semi-numeric regular
   expressions have been used for date part extraction. Dynamic Time
   Warping (DTW) and profile feature-based approaches are used for
   classification of month/non-month words. Other date components such as
   numerals and punctuation marks are recognised using a gradient-based
   feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are
   performed on English, Devnagari and Bangla document datasets and the
   encouraging results obtained from the system indicate the effectiveness
   of the proposed system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: With the development of biomedicine, the number of
   biomedical documents has increased rapidly bringing a great challenge
   for researchers trying to retrieve the information they need.
   Information retrieval aims to meet this challenge by searching relevant
   documents from abundant documents based on the given query. However,
   sometimes the relevance of search results needs to be evaluated from
   multiple aspects in specific retrieval tasks, thereby increasing the
   difficulty of biomedical information retrieval.
   Objective: This study aimed to find a more systematic method for
   retrieving relevant scientific literature for a given patient.
   Methods: In the initial retrieval stage, we supplemented query terms
   through query expansion strategies and applied query boosting to obtain
   an initial ranking list of relevant documents. In the re-ranking phase,
   we employed a text classification model and relevance matching model to
   evaluate documents from different dimensions and then combined the
   outputs through logistic regression to re-rank all the documents from
   the initial ranking list.
   Results: The proposed ensemble method contributed to the improvement of
   biomedical retrieval performance. Compared with the existing deep
   learning-based methods, experimental results showed that our method
   achieved state-of-the-art performance on the data collection provided by
   the Text Retrieval Conference 2019 Precision Medicine Track.
   Conclusions: In this paper, we proposed a novel ensemble method based on
   deep learning. As shown in the experiments, the strategies we used in
   the initial retrieval phase such as query expansion and query boosting
   are effective. The application of the text classification model and
   relevance matching model better captured semantic context information
   and improved retrieval performance.}},

Abstract = {{Because unprecedented volumes of multimedia data associated with spoken
   documents have been made available to the public, spoken document
   retrieval (SDR) has become an important research area in the past
   decades. Recently, representation learning has emerged as an active
   research topic in many machine learning applications owing largely to
   its excellent performance. In the context of natural language
   processing, the pioneering work can date back to the word embedding
   methods. However, learning of paragraph (or sentence and document)
   representations is more reasonable and suitable for some tasks, such as
   information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far
   as we are aware, there is relatively less work focusing on launching
   paragraph embedding methods into SDR. Motivated by these observations,
   this paper proposes a novel paragraph embedding method, named the
   localitypreserving essence vector (LPEV) model. LPEV is designed with
   consideration to two aspects. First, the model aims at not only
   distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but also
   getting rid of the general background information. Second, inspired by
   the local invariance perspective, which is a celebrated principle used
   in manifold learning techniques, LPEV also manages to preserve semantic
   locality in the learned low-dimensional embedding space for producing
   more informative and discriminative vector representations of
   paragraphs. On top of the proposed framework, a series of empirical SDR
   experiments conducted on the TDT-2 (Topic Detection and Tracking)
   collection demonstrate the good efficacy of our SDR methods as compared
   to existing strong baselines.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of digital technology and the desire to maintain an easy
   access to scanned documents implies the interest of Document Image
   Retrieval (DIR). In this paper, we propose a fuzzy graph-based document
   retrieval approach for determining similarity between document images
   for content-based document retrieval. To model the structure of document
   images, we have opted to use Attributed Relational Graphs (ARGs). For
   each document region (text, graphic, etc) we associate a node which is
   characterized by a set of fuzzy membership degrees reflecting low-level
   properties (texture, shape, color, etc). We use this fuzzy description
   in order to guarantee more robustness against the eventual segmentation
   errors which may be occurred after the segmentation of document regions.
   ARGs edges represent spatial relationships between regions which have
   common boundaries. Finally, we have developed a tree-search based
   optimal matching algorithm, which allows the search for document
   according to its structure. The database used for experiments is
   composed of segmented Coran document images from the National Library of
   Tunisia. Different weights are assigned for regions and edges according
   to their relative importance. The results obtained demonstrate the
   effectiveness of fuzzy graph-based document retrieval. Such an approach
   is very useful for several applications in many fields.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we improve the performance of the recently proposed
   Direct Query Classifier (dqc). The (dqc) is a classifier based retrieval
   method and in general, such methods have been shown to be superior to
   the OCR-based solutions for performing retrieval in many practical
   document image datasets. In (dqc), the classifiers are trained for a set
   of frequent queries and seamlessly extended for the rare and arbitrary
   queries. This extends the classifier based retrieval paradigm to an
   unlimited number of classes (words) present in a language. The (dqc)
   requires indexing cut-portions (n-grams) of the word image and dtw
   distance has been used for indexing. However, dtw is computationally
   slow and therefore limits the performance of the (dqc). We introduce
   query specific dtw distance, which enables effective computation of
   global principal alignments for novel queries. Since the proposed query
   specific dtw distance is a linear approximation of the dtw distance, it
   enhances the performance of the (dqc). Unlike previous approaches, the
   proposed query specific dtw distance uses both the class mean vectors
   and the query information for computing the global principal alignments
   for the query. Since the proposed method computes the global principal
   alignments using n-grams, it works well for both frequent and rare
   queries. We also use query expansion (qe) to further improve the
   performance of our query specific dtw. This also allows us to seamlessly
   adapt our solution to new fonts, styles and collections. We have
   demonstrated the utility of the proposed technique over 3 different
   datasets. The proposed query specific dtw performs well compared to the
   previous dtw approximations.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Sentiment-based text retrieval is an urgent and valuable task due to the
   explosive growth of sentiment expressed reviews from social networks
   like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Social networks within the
   domain of Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) make it much easier to
   dynamically discover desirable services and valuable information.
   Information retrieval in social media is a daunting task which requires
   a lot of technical insights. As a powerful tool for large-scale
   information retrieval, hashing techniques have also been extensively
   employed for text retrieval. However, most existing text hashing methods
   are impractical for sentiment-expressed text retrieval mainly for three
   reasons: (1) the text representations are captured by shallow machine
   learning algorithms; (2) sentiment is rarely considered when measuring
   the similarity of two documents; and (3) unsupervised learning of hash
   functions is employed due to the lack of hash labels. To address these
   problems, in this paper, we put forward a general deep sentiment hashing
   model, which is composed of three steps. First, a hierarchical
   attention-based Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is trained to
   obtain sentiment-specific document representations. Second, given the
   document embeddings, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm is used to
   construct a Laplacian matrix which is projected into hash labels via
   Laplacian Eigenmaps (LapEig) later. Third, we build a deep model for
   hash functions learning, which is supervised by both the generated hash
   labels and the original sentiment labels. Such joint supervision ensures
   that the ultimate hash codes produced by the learned hash functions
   maintain sentiment-level similarity. Experimental results turn out that
   the proposed approach achieves an effective and outstanding retrieval
   performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Public crisis has the characteristics of suddenness and uncertainty, and
   it is necessary to combine the knowledge with the experience of other
   similar situations to make decisions effectively and quickly. This work
   combines artificial intelligent theory with information technology and
   brings case-based reasoning to build models consisting of the features
   of public crisis. We explore the case-representation approach and build
   a case-based retrieval algorithm. Combining the specificness of
   Case-based reasoning (CBR) technology in the monitoring of public crisis
   events, a new case retrieval algorithm for public crisis cases, named as
   Combined multi-similarity with set of simi-larity matching algorithm
   based on sememe (CMSBS), is proposed to analyze the cases with high
   similarity to current case. The CMSBS algorithm considers the structural
   and semantic similarities between two public crisis cases
   comprehensively. Simulation experiments are performed to validate the
   representation method of the knowledge, and the simulation results
   demonstrate that the CMSBS algorithm has superior performance in the
   average number of matching cases and matching accuracy rate and can work
   well in providing reference cases for subsequent events.}},

Abstract = {{Existing dominant approaches for cross-modal video-text retrieval task
   are to learn a joint embedding space to measure the cross-modal
   similarity. However, these methods rarely explore long-range dependency
   inside video frames or textual words leading to insufficient textual and
   visual details. In this paper, we propose a stacked convolutional deep
   encoding network for video-text retrieval task, which considers to
   simultaneously encode long-range and short-range dependency in the
   videos and texts. Specifically, a multi-scale dilated convolutional
   (MSDC) block within our approach is able to encode short-range temporal
   cues between video frames or text words by adopting different scales of
   kernel size and dilation size of convolutional layer. A stacked
   structure is designed to expand the receptive fields by repeatedly
   adopting the MSDC block, which further captures the long-range relations
   between these cues. Moreover, to obtain more robust textual
   representations, we fully utilize the powerful language model named
   Transformer in two stages: pretraining phrase and fine-tuning phrase.
   Extensive experiments on two different benchmark datasets (MSR-VTT,
   MSVD) show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{For multimedia applications, constructing a joint representation that
   could carry information for multiple modalities could be very conducive
   for downstream use cases. In this paper, we study how to effectively
   utilize available multimodal cues from videos in learning joint
   representations for the cross-modal video-text retrieval task. Existing
   hand-labeled video-text datasets are often very limited by their size
   considering the enormous amount of diversity the visual world contains.
   This makes it extremely difficult to develop a robust video-text
   retrieval system based on deep neural network models. In this regard, we
   propose a framework that simultaneously utilizes multimodal visual cues
   by a ``mixture of experts{''} approach for retrieval. We conduct
   extensive experiments to verify that our system is able to boost the
   performance of the retrieval task compared to the state of the art. In
   addition, we propose a modified pairwise ranking loss function in
   training the embedding and study the effect of various loss functions.
   Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields
   significant gain compared to the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{Question-oriented text retrieval, aka natural language-based text
   retrieval, has been widely used in software engineering. Earlier work
   has concluded that questions with the same keywords but different
   interrogatives (such as how, what) should result in different answers.
   But what is the difference? How to identify the right answers to a
   question? In this paper, we propose to investigate the ``answer
   style{''} of software questions with different interrogatives. Towards
   this end, we build classifiers in a software text repository and propose
   a re-ranking approach to refine search results. The classifiers are
   trained by over 16,000 answers from the StackOverflow forum. Each answer
   is labeled accurately by its question's explicit or implicit
   interrogatives. We have evaluated the performance of our classifiers and
   the refinement of our re-ranking approach in software text retrieval.
   Our approach results in 13.1\% and 12.6\% respectively improvement with
   respect to text retrieval criteria nDCG@1 and nDCG@10 compared to the
   baseline. We also apply our approach to FAQs of 7 open source projects
   and show 13.2\% improvement with respect to nDCG@1. The results of our
   experiments suggest that our approach could find answers to FAQs more
   precisely.}},

Title = {{Building a text collection for Urdu information retrieval}},
Journal = {{ETRI JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Urdu is a widely spoken language in the Indian subcontinent with over
   300 million speakers worldwide. However, linguistic advancements in Urdu
   are rare compared to those in other European and Asian languages.
   Therefore, by following Text Retrieval Conference standards, we
   attempted to construct an extensive text collection of 85 304 documents
   from diverse categories covering over 52 topics with relevance judgment
   sets at 100 pool depth. We also present several applications to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our collection. Although this
   collection is primarily intended for text retrieval, it can also be used
   for named entity recognition, text summarization, and other linguistic
   applications with suitable modifications. Ours is the most extensive
   existing collection for the Urdu language, and it will be freely
   available for future research and academic education.}},

Title = {{Two-Stage Document Length Normalization for Information Retrieval}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The standard approach for term frequency normalization is based only on
   the document length. However, it does not distinguish the verbosity from
   the scope, these being the two main factors determining the document
   length. Because the verbosity and scope have largely different effects
   on the increase in term frequency, the standard approach can easily
   suffer from insufficient or excessive penalization depending on the
   specific type of long document. To overcome these problems, this article
   proposes two-stage normalization by performing verbosity and scope
   normalization separately, and by employing different penalization
   functions. In verbosity normalization, each document is prenormalized by
   dividing the term frequency by the verbosity of the document. In scope
   normalization, an existing retrieval model is applied in a
   straightforward manner to the prenormalized document, finally leading us
   to formulate our proposed verbosity normalized (VN) retrieval model.
   Experimental results carried out on standard TREC collections
   demonstrate that the VN model leads to marginal but statistically
   significant improvements over standard retrieval models.}},

Abstract = {{To verify the identity of users, the majority of computer systems employ
   conventional authentication schemes such as Personal Identification
   Number (PIN), password and token. Over the years, these schemes have
   become less robust as they can be guessed, cracked, stolen or shared.
   Biometric-based authentication methods have positioned themselves as
   better options as they do not suffer from the same limitations as
   conventional methods. The reason being that biometrics exploit the
   uniqueness of a subject with regards to what they are or how they
   behave. In this paper, we investigate the use of a behavioural
   biometric, Keystroke Dynamics (KSD) as a means of identity verification
   for online persons. We present the proof-of-concept of a novel keystroke
   dynamics authentication method that is based on text retrieval concepts
   and methods. We test our algorithm on a classification task and achieve
   promising results. Furthermore, we show experimentally that a person's
   typing behaviour is susceptible to the environment in which they are
   typing.}},

Abstract = {{Arabic language is one of most enrich Semitic languages due to it has
   many concepts which related together in different semantic
   relationships. That makes Arabic information retrieval face more
   challenge to access the information needs. In addition, Arabic language
   more efficient of retrieval systems to be able of understanding,
   analysing texts, and extracting semantic relationships between concepts.
   This paper aims to introduce a method of improving of the information
   retrieval in Arabic documents. The proposed method is a semantic
   analysis of Arabic texts which helps to access the target documents that
   spread over the web. This approach used the Arabic WordNet to analyse
   both query, and documents in standard Arabic test collection to
   facilitate retrieval the related documents. The core goal of this
   approach is an enhancement of the evaluation measurements for Arabic
   information retrieval systems. Furthermore, this study used an other
   traditional method called words-matching to compare the results of the
   proposed method in selected queries from standard test collection. The
   experimental results of 5-queries show the degree of the performance of
   the proposed method. The proposed approach showed an efficient results
   of information retrieval measurement through compare recall, and
   precision with other traditional method that has been applied in this
   same test collection. The mean average was about our algorithms, keyword
   searching, and query-expansion were 0.826364, and 0.576666457,
   respectively. That indicates a slightly improvement of the performance
   of proposed semantic analysis approach in the information retrieval in
   Arabic documents.}},

Abstract = {{Users face the Vocabulary Gap problem when attempting to retrieve
   relevant textual documents from small databases, especially when there
   are only a small number of relevant documents, as it is likely that
   different terms are used in queries and relevant documents to describe
   the same concept. To enable comparison of results of different
   approaches to semantic search in small textual databases, the PIKES team
   constructed an annotated test collection and Gold Standard comprising 35
   search queries and 331 articles. We present two different possible
   solutions. In one, we index an unannotated version of the PIKES
   collection using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) retrieving relevant
   documents using a combination of query coordination and automatic
   relevance feedback. Although we outperform prior work, this approach is
   dependent on the underlying collection, and is not necessarily scalable.
   In the second approach, we use an LSA Model generated by SEMILAR from a
   Wikipedia dump to generate a Term Similarity Matrix (TSM). Queries are
   automatically expanded with related terms from the TSM and are submitted
   to a term-by-document matrix Vector Space Model of the PIKES collection.
   Coupled with a combination of query coordination and automatic relevance
   feedback we also outperform prior work with this approach. The advantage
   of the second approach is that it is independent of the underlying
   document collection.}},

Abstract = {{Current data warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)
   systems are not yet particularly appropriate for textual data analysis.
   It is therefore crucial to develop a new data model and an OLAP system
   to provide the necessary analyses for textual data. To achieve this
   objective, this paper proposes a new approach based on information
   retrieval (IR) techniques. Moreover, several contextual factors may
   significantly affect the information relevant to a decision-maker. Thus,
   the paper proposes to consider contextual factors in an OLAP system to
   provide relevant results. It provides a generalized approach for Text
   OLAP analysis which consists of two parts: The first one is a
   context-based text cube model, denoted CXT-Cube. It is characterized by
   several contextual dimensions. Hence, during the OLAP analysis process,
   CXT-Cube exploits the contextual information in order to better consider
   the semantics of textual data. Besides, the work associates to CXT-Cube
   a new text analysis measure based on an OLAP-adapted vector space model
   and a relevance propagation technique. The second part is an OLAP
   aggregation operator called ORank (OLAP-Rank) which allows to aggregate
   textual data in an OLAP environment while considering relevant
   contextual factors. To consider the user context, this paper proposes a
   query expansion method based on a decision-maker profile. Based on IR
   metrics, it evaluates the proposed aggregation operator in different
   cases using several data analysis queries. The evaluation shows that the
   precision of the system is significantly better than that of a Text OLAP
   system based on classical IR. This is due to the consideration of the
   contextual factors.}},

Abstract = {{Everyone is in the need of accurate and efficient information retrieval
   in no time. Search engines are the main source to extract the required
   information, when a user search a query and wants to generate the
   results. Different search engines provide different Application
   Programming Interface (API) and Libraries to the researchers and the
   programmers to access the data that has been stored in servers of the
   search engines. When a researcher or programmer search's a query by
   using API, it returns a Java Script Orientation Notation (JSON) file. In
   this JSON file, information is encapsulated where scraping techniques
   are used to filter out the text. The aim of this paper is to propose a
   different approach to effectively and efficiently filter out the queries
   based on text which has been searched by the search engines and return
   the most appropriate results to the users after matching the searched
   text because the previous techniques which are used are not enough
   efficient. We use different comparison techniques, i.e. Sequence Matcher
   Method and then compare the results of this technique with relevance
   feedback and in the end we found that our proposed technique is
   providing much better results.}},

Abstract = {{Term dependency models are generally better than bag-of-word models,
   because complete concepts are often represented by multiple terms.
   However, without semantic knowledge, such models may introduce many
   false dependencies among terms, especially when the document collection
   is small and homogeneous(e.g. newswire documents, medical documents).
   The main contribution of this work is to incorporate semantic knowledge
   with term dependency models, so that more accurate dependency relations
   will be assigned to terms in the query. In this paper, experiments will
   be made on CLEF2013 eHealth Lab medical information retrieval data set,
   and the baseline term dependency model will be the popular MRF(Markov
   Random Field) model {[}1], which proves to be better than traditional
   independent models in general domain search. Experiment results show
   that, in medical document retrieval, full dependency MRF model is worse
   than independent model, it can be significantly improved by
   incorporating semantic knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Information Retrieval system plays an essential role in web services.
   However, the web services in which users can upload files as attachments
   typically do not support enough search conditions and often rely only on

   present a topic-model based framework for fast and effective Content
   Based Document Information Retrieval that retrieves the information from
   the actual contents in the attachment. The proposed systems is analyzed
   and compared with conventional methods in various aspects. In
   particular, we propose an efficient keyword extraction method based on
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is compared with the Term Frequency
   Inverse Document Frequency approach typically used in conventional
   systems. Moreover, a per-category indexing structure is also proposed
   and compared with the existing total indexing scheme. Our experimental
   results validate the utility of the proposed system for web services

Abstract = {{Using domain knowledge and semantics to conduct effective document
   retrieval has attracted great attention from researchers in many
   different communities. Ultilizing that approach, we presents the method
   for designing domain-specific document retrieval systems, which manages

   processing in search. The proposed method integrates components such as
   an ontology describing domain knowledge, a database of document
   repository, semantic representations for documents; and advanced search
   techniques based on measuring semantic similarity. In this article, a
   model of domain knowledge for various information retrieval tasks,
   called The Classed Keyphrase based Ontology (CK-ONTO), will be presented
   in details. We also present graph-based models for representing
   documents together measures for evaluating the semantic relevance for
   usage in searching. The above methodology has been used in designing
   many real-world applications such as the Job-posting retrieval system.
   Evaluation with real-world inspired dataset, our methods showed

Abstract = {{Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is one of the well-known searching
   techniques where documents are retrieved based on the content similarity
   or meaning of the documents. LSI is an effective method to improve the
   retrieval performance, however, as the size of documents gets larger; a
   better technique is needed to process the documents faster. In this
   paper, a new parallel LSI algorithm which runs on standard multi-core
   personal computer (PC) is proposed to improve the performance of
   retrieving relevant documents. The parallel LSI algorithm uses parallel
   threads to automatically perform the matrix computations using the
   Fork-Join approach. 2028 text documents extracted from four volumes of
   the Malay-translated book of Hadith known as Shahih Bukhari were used as
   the test collections. We compare the time to process LSI space between
   both sequential and parallel systems. The percentage of recall,
   precision and effectiveness for retrieving relevant document are also
   measured for both systems using the Information Retrieval (IR) metrics
   which are recall, precision, and effectiveness. The results show that
   the time taken to create LSI space for parallel system is faster than
   sequential system. Based on recall, precision and effectiveness
   measures, our proposed parallel LSI system is comparable to sequential
   LSI system.}},

Abstract = {{Document retrieval systems recover documents from a database and order
   them according to their perceived relevance to a user's search query.
   This is a difficult task for machines to accomplish because there exists
   a semantic gap between the meaning of the terms in a user's literal
   query and a user's true intentions. The main goal of this study is to
   modify the Okapi BM25 document retrieval system to improve search
   results for textual queries and unstructured, textual corpora. This
   research hypothesizes that Okapi BM25 is not taking full advantage of
   the structure of text inside documents. This structure holds valuable
   semantic information that can be used to increase the model's accuracy.
   Modifications that account for a term's part of speech, the proximity
   between a pair of related terms, the proximity of a term with respect to
   its location in a document, and query expansion are used to augment
   Okapi BM25. The study resulted in 87 modifications which were all
   validated using open source corpora. The top scoring modification from
   the validation set was then tested under the Lisa corpus and the model
   performed 10.25\% better than Okapi BM25 when evaluated under mean

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a novel principled approach to passage-based
   (document) retrieval using fuzzy set theory. The approach formulates
   passage score combination according to general relevance decision
   principles. By operationalizing these principles using aggregation
   operators of fuzzy set theory, our approach justifies the common
   heuristics of taking the maximum constituent passage score as the
   overall document score. Experiments show that this heuristics is only
   the near best, with some fuzzy set aggregation operators stipulated in
   our approach being better methods. The significance of our principled
   approach is the applicability of many passage score combination methods,
   potentially bringing further performance enhancement. Experiments on
   several text retrieval conference collections demonstrate that our
   approach performs significantly better than document-based retrieval.
   While recent works in the literature mostly employ document-based rather
   than passage-based retrieval due to the common conception that document
   length normalization solves the problem of varying document lengths, our
   results show that document length normalization alone is not sufficient,
   especially in pseudo-relevance feedback retrieval.}},

Title = {{An end-to-end pseudo relevance feedback framework for neural document
   retrieval}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) is commonly used to boost the
   performance of traditional information retrieval (IR) models by using
   top-ranked documents to identify and weight new query terms, thereby
   reducing the effect of query-document vocabulary mismatches. While
   neural retrieval models have recently demonstrated promising results for
   ad-hoc document retrieval, combining them with PRF is not
   straightforward due to incompatibilities between existing PRF approaches
   and neural architectures. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end
   neural PRF framework, coined NPRF, that enriches the representation of
   user information need from a single query to multiple PRF documents.
   NPRF can be used with existing neural IR models by embedding different
   neural models as building blocks. Three state-of-the-art neural
   retrieval models, including the unigram DRMM and KNRM models, and the
   position-aware PACRR model, are utilized to instantiate the NPRF
   framework. Extensive experiments on two standard test collections,
   TREC1-3 and Robust04, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed NPRF
   framework in improving the performance of three state-of-the-art neural
   IR models. In addition, analysis shows that integrating the existing
   neural IR models within the NPRF framework results in reduced training
   and validation losses, and consequently, improved effectiveness of the
   learned ranking functions.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the rapid global access to tremendous amounts of multimedia
   associated with speech information on the Internet, spoken document
   retrieval (SDR) has become an emerging application recently. Apart from
   much effort devoted to developing robust indexing and modeling
   techniques for spoken documents, a recent line of research targets at
   enriching and reformulating query representations in an attempt to
   enhance retrieval effectiveness. In practice, pseudo-relevance feedback
   is by far the most prevalent paradigm for query reformulation, which
   assumes that top-ranked feedback documents obtained from the initial
   round of retrieval are potentially relevant and can be exploited to
   reformulate the original query. Continuing this line of research, the
   paper presents a novel modeling framework, which aims at discovering
   significant words occurring in the feedback documents, to infer an
   enhanced query language model for SDR. Formally, the proposed framework
   targets at extracting the essential words representing a common notion
   of relevance (i.e., the significant words which occur in almost all of
   the feedback documents), so as to deduce a new query language model that
   captures these significant words and meanwhile modulates the influence
   of both highly frequent words and too specific words. Experiments
   conducted on a benchmark SDR task demonstrate the performance merits of
   our proposed framework.}},

Title = {{A semi-explicit short text retrieval method combining Wikipedia features}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{94}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{With the advantages such as openness, interactivity, immediacy, and
   simplicity, the large number of short text data appear in the Web
   information space. Considering the short length, little information,
   sparse features and irregular grammar, the traditional information
   analyzing and retrieval technologies cannot deal with short text
   effectively. In view of the above problems, in this paper a new short
   text retrieval method based on the current mainstream semantic knowledge
   source, Wikipedia, is proposed. To be specific, a semantic feature
   selection algorithm is proposed to return the top k most relevant
   Wikipedia concepts as the whole vector space for a given short text.
   Thus, by analyzing the topic information of the semantic features
   contained in Wikipedia concepts, we propose some formulas to determine
   the association coefficient list between different components of the
   corresponding positions in two different feature vectors. On this basis,
   a new semantic relatedness assessment method under this lower
   dimensional semantic space is designed. According to computing and
   sorting the semantic relatedness between user queries and the target
   short text, a novel semi-explicit short text retrieval method combining
   Wikipedia concept feature and the corresponding topic information is
   proposed. Lastly, based on the experimental results on twitter subsets,
   we verify that our proposal has advantages over other some current
   retrieval methods on MAP, P@k and R-Prec, and can return more valid
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-media retrieval is to find the relationship between different
   modal samples, and to use some modal samples to search for other modal
   samples of approximate semantics. The existing cross-media retrieval
   method only utilizes the information of the image and part of the text,
   that is, the whole image and the whole sentence are matched, or some
   image areas and some words are matched. In order to make better use of
   the integrated features of image and text, this paper proposes a
   cross-media image-text retrieval method that integrates two-level
   similarity to explore better matching between image and text semantics.
   Specifically, in this method, the image is divided into the whole
   picture and some image areas, the text is divided into the whole
   sentences and some words, to study respectively, to explore the full
   potential alignment of images and text, and then a two-level alignment
   framework is used to promote each other, fusion of two kinds of
   similarity can learn to complete representation of cross-media
   retrieval. Experimental results on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets
   show that this model has a better recall rate than many of the current
   internationally advanced cross-media retrieval models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a text retrieval method based on vector space
   feature conversion. Even though knowledge-based semantic fingerprint
   information and semantic information obtained by the Tag-LDA topic model
   are two different representations of semantic features of the same text,
   they are incompatible with semantic information. Here we introduce the
   vector space as a bridge to transfer knowledge-based semantic
   fingerprint information space into the Tag-LDA model space and prove the
   rationality of the conversion process with correlation theory. The
   compatible semantic fingerprint information into the Tag-LDA model
   generate a new topic model STag-LDA. The Stag-LDA model has certain
   disambiguation effect for the semantic information of the tag. So, it
   can mine text semantic information more accurately to improve the
   retrieval efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A large software project usually has lots of various textual learning
   resources about its API, such as tutorials, mailing lists, user forums,
   etc. Text retrieval technology allows developers to search these API
   learning resources for related documents using free-text queries, but it
   suffers from the lexical gap between search queries and documents. In
   this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving the retrieval of
   API learning resources through leveraging software-specific conceptual
   knowledge in software source code. The basic idea behind this approach
   is that the semantic relatedness between queries and documents could be
   measured according to software-specific concepts involved in them, and
   software source code contains a large amount of software-specific
   conceptual knowledge. In detail, firstly we extract an API graph from
   software source code and use it as software-specific conceptual
   knowledge. Then we discover API entities involved in queries and
   documents, and infer semantic document relatedness through analyzing
   structural relationships between these API entities. We evaluate our
   approach in three popular open source software projects. Comparing to
   the state-of-the-art text retrieval approaches, our approach lead to at
   least 13.77\% improvement with respect to mean average precision (MAP).}},

Abstract = {{Cross-modal image-text retrieval has emerged as a challenging task that
   requires the multimedia system to bridge the heterogeneity gap between
   different modalities. In this paper, we take full advantage of
   image-to-text and text-to-image generation models to improve the
   performance of the cross-modal image-text retrieval model by
   incorporating the text-grounded and image-grounded generative features
   into the cross-modal common space with a ``Two-Teacher One-Student{''}
   learning framework. In addition, a dual regularizer network is designed
   to distinguish the mismatched image-text pairs from the matched ones. In
   this way, we can capture the fine-grained correspondence between
   modalities and distinguish the best-retrieved result from a candidate
   set. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e.,
   MIRFLICKR-25K, NUS-WIDE, and MS COCO) show that our model can achieve
   state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval results. In particular, our model
   improves the image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval accuracy by more
   than 22\% over the best competitors on the MS COCO dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-modal retrieval between visual data and natural language
   description remains a long-standing challenge in multimedia. While
   recent image-text retrieval methods offer great promise by learning deep
   representations aligned across modalities, most of these methods are
   plagued by the issue of training with small-scale datasets covering a
   limited number of images with ground-truth sentences. Moreover, it is
   extremely expensive to create a larger dataset by annotating millions of
   images with sentences and may lead to a biased model. Inspired by the
   recent success of webly supervised learning in deep neural networks, we
   capitalize on readily-available web images with noisy annotations to
   learn robust image-text joint representation. Specifically, our main
   idea is to leverage web images and corresponding tags, along with fully
   annotated datasets, in training for learning the visual-semantic joint
   embedding. We propose a two stage approach for the task that can augment
   a typical supervised pair-wise ranking loss based formulation with
   weakly-annotated web images to learn a more robust visual-semantic
   embedding. Experiments on two standard benchmark datasets demonstrate
   that our method achieves a significant performance gain in image-text
   retrieval compared to state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-grained image-text retrieval aims at searching relevant images
   among fine-grained classes given a text query or in a reverse way. The
   challenges are not only bridging the gap between two heterogeneous

   above challenges, we propose a Discriminative Latent Space Learning
   (DLSL) method for fine-grained image-text retrieval. Concretely, image
   and text features are extracted for capturing the subtle difference in
   fine-grained data. Subsequently, based on the extracted features, we
   perform couple dictionary learning to align the heterogeneous data in a
   uniform latent space. To make such alignment discriminative enough for
   the fine-grained task, the learned latent space is endowed with
   discriminative property via learning a discriminative map. Comprehensive
   experiments on fine-grained datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Text Retrieval (TR) has been widely used to support many software
   engineering tasks, including bug localization (i.e., the activity of
   localizing buggy code starting from a bug report). Many studies show
   TR's effectiveness in lowering the manual effort required to perform
   this maintenance task; however, the actual usefulness of TR-based bug
   localization has been questioned in recent studies. These studies
   discuss (i) potential biases in the experimental design usually adopted
   to evaluate TR-based bug localization techniques and (ii) their poor
   performance in the scenario when they are needed most: when the bug
   report, which serves as the de facto query in most studies, does not
   contain localization hints (e.g., code snippets, method names, etc.)
   Fundamentally, these studies raise the question: do bug reports provide
   sufficient information to perform TR-based localization?
   In this work, we approach that question from two perspectives. First, we
   investigate potential biases in the evaluation of TR-based approaches
   which artificially boost the performance of these techniques, making
   them appear more successful than they are. Second, we analyze bug report
   text with and without localization hints using a genetic algorithm to
   derive a near-optimal query that provides insight into the potential of
   that bug report for use in TR-based localization. Through this analysis
   we show that in most cases the bug report vocabulary (i. e., the terms
   contained in the bug title and description) is all we need to formulate
   effective queries, making TR-based bug localization successful without
   supplementary query expansion. Most notably, this also holds when
   localization hints are completely absent from the bug report. In fact,
   our results suggest that the next major step in improving TR-based bug
   localization is the ability to formulate these near-optimal queries.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{When ranking a list of documents relative to a given query, the
   vocabulary mismatches could compromise the performance, as a result of
   the different language used in the queries and the documents. Though the
   BERT-based re-ranker have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art,
   such mismatch still exist. Moreover, recent works demonstrated that it
   is non-trivial to use the established query expansion methods to boost
   the performance of BERT-based re-rankers. Henceforth, this paper
   proposes a novel query expansion model using unsupervised chunk
   selection, coined as BERT-QE. In particular, BERT-QE consists of three
   phases. After performing the first-round re-ranking in phase one,
   BERT-QE leverages the strength of the BERT model to select relevant text
   chunks from feedback documents in phase two and uses them for the final
   re ranking in phase three. Furthermore, different variants of BERT-QE
   are thoroughly investigated for a better trade-off between effectiveness
   and efficiency, including the uses of smaller BERT variants and of
   recently proposed late interaction methods. On the standard TREC
   Robust04 and GOV2 test collections, the proposed BERT-QE model
   significantly outperforms BERT-Large models. Actually, the best variant
   of BERT-QE can outperform BERT-Large significantly on shallow metrics
   with less than 1\% extra computations.}},

Title = {{Spoken Content Retrieval-Beyond Cascading Speech Recognition with Text
   Retrieval}},
Journal = {{IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1389-1420}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Spoken content retrieval refers to directly indexing and retrieving
   spoken content based on the audio rather than text descriptions. This
   potentially eliminates the requirement of producing text descriptions
   for multimedia content for indexing and retrieval purposes, and is able
   to precisely locate the exact time the desired information appears in
   the multimedia. Spoken content retrieval has been very successfully
   achieved with the basic approach of cascading automatic speech
   recognition (ASR) with text information retrieval: after the spoken
   content is transcribed into text or lattice format, a text retrieval
   engine searches over the ASR output to find desired information. This
   framework works well when the ASR accuracy is relatively high, but
   becomes less adequate when more challenging real-world scenarios are
   considered, since retrieval performance depends heavily on ASR accuracy.
   This challenge leads to the emergence of another approach to spoken
   content retrieval: to go beyond the basic framework of cascading ASR
   with text retrieval in order to have retrieval performances that are
   less dependent on ASR accuracy. This overview article is intended to
   provide a thorough overview of the concepts, principles, approaches, and
   achievements of major technical contributions along this line of
   investigation. This includes five major directions: 1) Modified ASR for
   Retrieval Purposes: cascading ASR with text retrieval, but the ASR is
   modified or optimized for spoken content retrieval purposes; 2)
   Exploiting the Information not present in ASR outputs: to try to utilize
   the information in speech signals inevitably lost when transcribed into
   phonemes and words; 3) Directly Matching at the Acoustic Level without
   ASR: for spoken queries, the signals can be directly matched at the
   acoustic level, rather than at the phoneme or word levels, bypassing all
   ASR issues; 4) Semantic Retrieval of Spoken Content: trying to retrieve
   spoken content that is semantically related to the query, but not
   necessarily including the query terms themselves; 5) Interactive
   Retrieval and Efficient Presentation of the Retrieved Objects: with
   efficient presentation of the retrieved objects, an interactive
   retrieval process incorporating user actions may produce better
   retrieval results and user experiences.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to compute semantic similarity between
   sentences. It is based on the semantic kernel, composed of subject,
   verb, and object that, we suppose, summarize the general meaning of each
   sentence. Thanks to linguistics resources available such as Stanford
   Parser, many features are then extracted from the semantic kernels and
   aggregated by mean of weights. The weighting is produced by a supervised
   machine learning technique on a training data set provided by human
   experts as ground truth. The cross validation shows good performances.
   Thanks to this similarity measure between sentences, one can build an
   intelligent text retrieval engine more sensitive to the semantic
   content, specifically suited for short texts than the classical methods
   based on bag of words. An application is being developed for
   highlighting parts of speech in scientific articles.}},

Abstract = {{We examine how the Hopfield auto-associative memory network {[}1] can be
   adapted for text retrieval to realize its ideal functionality as a
   content-based information retrieval system. Towards this, we examine
   various issues such as (i) how the capacity of the Hopfield net is
   limited (far below the theoretical limit) for correlated patterns, and
   how its capacity is significantly enhanced by the Pseudo-inverse
   learning rule, and (ii) the performance characterization of retrieval
   under two types of queries, namely, queries with substitution errors and
   partial queries. We present results on large text databases and
   establish the practical scalability of both the storage capacity and the
   retrieval robustness of the Hopfield network for content-based retrieval
   of text data.
   In this work, we use two data sets of text patterns (sentences made of
   sequence of letters from the English alphabet and special characters,
   with each character binarized by its 8-bit ASCII code), as shown in Fig.

Abstract = {{A generalized ensemble model (gEnM) for document ranking is proposed in
   this paper. The gEnM linearly combines the document retrieval models and
   tries to retrieve relevant documents at high positions. In order to
   obtain the optimal linear combination of multiple document retrieval
   models or rankers, an optimization program is formulated by directly
   maximizing the mean average precision. Both supervised and unsupervised
   learning algorithms are presented to solve this program. For the
   supervised scheme, two approaches are considered based on the data
   setting, namely batch and online setting. In the batch setting, we
   propose a revised Newton's algorithm, gEnM. BAT, by approximating the
   derivative and Hessian matrix. In the online setting, we advocate a
   stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based algorithm-gEnM. ON. As for the
   unsupervised scheme, an unsupervised ensemble model (UnsEnM) by
   iteratively co-learning from each constituent ranker is presented.
   Experimental study on benchmark data sets verifies the effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithms. Therefore, with appropriate algorithms, the
   gEnM is a viable option in diverse practical information retrieval
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Various dynasties ruled the Indian sub-continent and left behind
   enormous and rich cultural heritage that also included intellectually
   enriched research in the shape of various documents scripted in Urdu. In
   order to provide efficient access to this knowledge, analysis though
   digitizing the existing work is the need of hour. In addition to
   digitization, efficient search mechanisms also need to be implemented to
   provide users a rapid access to the queried information. In most cases,
   the digitized documents are complemented by manually assigned tags which
   not only is a time consuming task but also provides a very limited
   search facility. Automating the transcription of these documents using
   Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems is also challenging due to
   the very complex cursive nature of Urdu text. To overcome these
   limitations, a keyword spotting based information retrieval system for
   document images is introduced in this study. The proposed technique
   relies on two major modules, document indexing and retrieval. Images of
   documents are segmented into partial words (ligatures) and identical
   partial words (PWs) are grouped into clusters. We introduce the concept
   of considering each (partial) word as a unique shape and a set of shape
   descriptors is extracted to characterize the PWs. The clusters of PWs
   are used to index a given set of documents. During retrieval, the query
   word presented to the system is matched with the clusters in the
   database and all documents containing instances of the query word are
   retrieved and presented to the user. The system evaluated on a set of
   printed Urdu documents in Nastaliq font realized promising precision and
   recall rates.}},

Title = {{DL-VSM based document indexing approach for information retrieval}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING}},
Abstract = {{Textual information is constantly increasing. With this accumulation of
   documents, the satisfaction of user needs becomes more and more complex.
   For that, several information retrieval systems have been designed in
   order to respond to user requests. Document indexing is considered as a
   crucial phase in the information retrieval field. The main contribution
   of the current work resides in the suggestion of a novel hybrid approach
   for biomedical document indexing. We improve the estimation of the
   correspondence between a document and a given concept using two methods:
   vector space model (VSM) and description logics (DL). VSM performs
   partial matching between documents and external resource terms. DL
   allows representing knowledge in a relevant manner for better matching.
   The proposed contribution reduces the limitation of exact matching. It
   serves to index documents by exploiting medical subject headings (MeSH)
   thesaurus services with approximate matching. The latter partially
   matches document terms with biomedical vocabularies to extract other
   morphological variants in that resource. It also generates irrelevant
   concepts. The filtering step solves this problem and grants the
   selection of the most important concepts by exploiting the knowledge
   provided by MeSH. The experiments, carried out on different corpora,
   show encouraging results (+ 25\% improvement in average accuracy
   compared to other approaches in the literature).}},

Abstract = {{In most of the classical information retrieval models, documents are
   represented as bag-of words which takes into account the term
   frequencies (tf) and inverse document frequencies (idf) while they
   ignore the term proximity. Recently, term proximity among query terms
   has been observed to be beneficial for improving performance of document
   retrieval. Several applications of the retrieval have implemented tools
   to determine term proximity at the query formulation level. They rank
   documents based on the relative positions of the query terms within the
   documents. They must store all proximity data in the index, leading to a
   large index, which slows the search. Recently, many models use term
   signal representation to represent a query term, the query is
   transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain using
   transformation techniques such as wavelet. Discrete Wavelet Transform
   (DWT) uses multiple resolutions technique by which different frequencies
   are analyzed with different resolutions. The advantage of the DWT is to
   consider the spatial information of the query terms within the document
   rather than using only the count of terms. In this paper, in order to
   improve ranking score as well as improve the run-time efficiency to
   resolve the query, and maintain a reasonable space for the index, three
   different types of spectral analysis based on semantic segmentation are
   carried out namely: sentence-based segmentation, paragraph-based
   segmentation and fixed length segmentation; and also different term
   weighting is performed according to term position.}},

Title = {{Word-embedding-based query expansion: Incorporating Deep Averaging
   Networks in Arabic document retrieval}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{One of the main issues associated with search engines is the
   query-document vocabulary mismatch problem, a long-standing problem in
   Information Retrieval (IR). This problem occurs when a user query does
   not match the content of stored documents, and it affects most search
   tasks. Automatic query expansion (AQE) is one of the most common
   approaches used to address this problem. Various AQE techniques have
   been proposed; these mainly involve finding synonyms or related words
   for the query terms. Word embedding (WE) is one of the methods that are
   currently receiving significant attention. Most of the existing AQE
   techniques focus on expanding the individual query terms rather the
   entire query during the expansion process, and this can lead to query
   drift if poor expansion terms are selected. In this article, we
   introduce Deep Averaging Networks (DANs), an architecture that feeds the
   average of the WE vectors produced by the Word2Vec toolkit for the terms
   in a query through several linear neural network layers. This average
   vector is assumed to represent the meaning of the query as a whole and
   can be used to find expansion terms that are relevant to the complete
   query. We explore the potential of DANs for AQE in Arabic document
   retrieval. We experiment with using DANs for AQE in the classic
   probabilistic BM25 model as well as for two recent expansion strategies:
   Embedding-Based Query Expansion approach (EQE1) and Prospect-Guided
   Query Expansion Strategy (V2Q). Although DANs did not improve all
   outcomes when used in the BM25 model, it outperformed all baselines when
   incorporated into the EQE1 and V2Q expansion strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for the performance improvement and robustness of
   automatic transcription of spontaneous speech in Slovak forces us to
   look for the advanced methods of adaptation of acoustic and language
   models to the user-specific voice characteristics and the topic of their
   speech. One of the ways how to increase the domain robustness of
   language models is to improve the process of retrieving text documents
   relevant to the current topic of the speech and use them to adapt the
   existing background language model. This paper focuses on the analysis,
   design and implementation of a new dual-space re-ranking model for
   document retrieval, adaptation of language models to the current topic
   of speech and personalization of speech recognition system. The
   experimental results of the proposed dual-space re ranking model based
   on the averaging coefficients produced by latent semantic indexing and
   paragraph vectors ranking models show an additional 1 \% relative
   improvement in word error rate against the efficiency of single-space
   model ranking.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of documents in different languages, the increased
   accessibility of electronic documents, and the availability of
   translation tools have caused cross-lingual plagiarism detection
   research area to receive increasing attention in recent years. The task
   of cross-language plagiarism detection entails two main steps: candidate
   retrieval and assessing pairwise document similarity. In this paper we
   examine candidate retrieval, where the goal is to find potential source
   documents of a suspicious text. Our proposed method for cross-language
   plagiarism detection is a keyword-focused approach. Since plagiarism
   usually happens in parts of the text, there is a requirement to segment
   the texts into fragments to detect local similarity. Therefore we
   propose a topic-based segmentation algorithm to convert the suspicious
   document to a set of related passages. After that, we use a
   proximity-based Model to retrieve documents with the best matching
   passages. Experiments show promising results for this important phase of
   cross-language plagiarism detection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Time is an important aspect in temporal information retrieval (TIR), a
   subfield of information retrieval (IR). Web search engines like Google
   or Bing are common examples of IR systems. An important constituent of a
   search engine is news retrieval, where users present their information
   needs in the form of temporal queries. Users are usually interested in
   news documents focusing on a particular time period. Existing search
   engines rarely fulfill the temporal information requirements as they
   ignore the temporal information available in the content of news
   documents, also known as document focus time. Furthermore, information
   related to multiple time periods in a news document makes the
   identification of document focus time a challenging task. Therefore, it
   is necessary to classify news documents based on temporal specificity
   before it is possible to use the temporal information in the retrieval
   process. In this study, we formulate the temporal specificity problem as
   a time-based classification task by classifying news documents into
   three temporal classes, i.e. high temporal specificity, medium temporal
   specificity, and low temporal specificity. For such classification,
   rule-based and temporal specificity score (TSS)-based classification
   approaches are proposed. In the former approach, news documents are
   classified using a defined set of rules that are based on temporal
   features. The later approach classifies news documents based on a TSS
   score using the temporal features. The results of the proposed
   techniques are compared with four machine learning classification
   algorithms: Bayes net, support vector machine, random forest, and
   decision tree. The results show that the proposed rule-based classifier
   outperforms the four algorithms by achieving 82\% accuracy, whereas TSS
   classification achieves 77\% accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient access to chemical information contained in scientific
   literature, patents, technical reports, or the web is a pressing need
   shared by researchers and patent attorneys from different chemical
   disciplines. Retrieval of important chemical information in most cases
   starts with finding relevant documents for a particular chemical
   compound or family. Targeted retrieval of chemical documents is closely
   connected to the automatic recognition of chemical entities in the text,
   which commonly involves the extraction of the entire list of chemicals
   mentioned in a document, including any associated information. In this
   Review, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth description of
   fundamental concepts, technical implementations, and current
   technologies for meeting these information demands. A strong focus is
   placed on community challenges addressing systems performance, more
   particularly CHEMDNER and CHEMDNER patents tasks of BioCreative IV and
   V, respectively. Considering the growing interest in the construction of
   automatically annotated chemical knowledge bases that integrate chemical
   information and biological data, cheminformatics approaches for mapping
   the extracted chemical names into chemical structures and their
   subsequent annotation together with text mining applications for linking
   chemistry with biological information are also presented. Finally,
   future trends and current challenges are highlighted as a roadmap

Abstract = {{A patent is a property granted to any new shape, configuration or
   arrangement of elements, of any device, tool, instrument, mechanism or
   other object or part thereof, that allows for a better or different
   operation, use or manufacture of the object that incorporates it or that
   provides it with some utility, advantage or technical effect that it did
   not have before. As a document, a patent really is a title that
   recognizes the right to exploit the patented invention exclusively,
   preventing others from making, selling or using it without the consent
   of the owner. The fact of making a patent is motivated by the fact of
   promoting creativity, hindering competition in the market as only one
   person holds the patent, thus protecting the initial investment and
   fighting against plagiarism. Patents are available to the public for
   dissemination and general knowledge. It is generally recognized in the
   specialized literature that patents can be used as an indicator to
   calculate the results generated by research and development activities,
   being a very useful indicator to measure various social, economic or
   technological aspects. For this reason, it is of relevant interest to
   have tools or systems that allow us to obtain the patents developed in a
   specific perspective of society's progress in the technological field,
   and this is why an analysis of patents is of our interest. This paper
   proposes a platform specifically designed to obtain knowledge about
   patents as an indicator of Spanish social, economic or technological
   aspects. For this purpose, the platform retrieves, analyses and
   visualizes functionalities that represent data on the landscape of
   patents obtained from the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office (OEPM) as
   a particular case of study.}},

Abstract = {{User modeling methods are developed by many researches in area of
   document retrieval systems. The main reason is that the system can not
   present the same results for every user. Each user can have different
   information needs even if he uses the same terms to formulate his query.
   In this paper we present the solution for the problem. We propose a
   method for user profile building and updating using Bayesian network
   approaches which allows to discover dependencies between terms.
   Additionally, we use domain ontology of terms to simplify the
   calculations. Performed experiments have shown that the quality of
   presented methods is promising.}},

   training data sets due to the high dimensionality of the native feature

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose to boost low-resource cross-lingual document
   retrieval performance with deep bilingual query-document
   representations. We match queries and documents in both source and
   target languages with four components, each of which is implemented as a
   term interaction-based deep neural network with cross-lingual word
   embeddings as input. By including query likelihood scores as extra
   features, our model effectively learns to rerank the retrieved documents
   by using a small number of relevance labels for low-resource language
   pairs. Due to the shared cross-lingual word embedding space, the model
   can also be directly applied to another language pair without any
   training label. Experimental results on the MATERIAL dataset show that
   our model outperforms the competitive translation-based baselines on
   English-Swahili, English-Tagalog, and English-Somali cross-lingual

Abstract = {{Automatic text summarization is a process of condensing the content of a
   text document to pursue the most important information. It plays a
   significant role in various tasks like text categorization, question
   answering and information retrieval (IR). As legal information retrieval
   (LIR) is a subfield of IR, the produced summaries are combined into IR
   system, with the objective of decreasing the length of the document. In
   this way, we can improve the access time for searching the information,
   and relevant documents are retrieved. In this article, we present the
   creation of passage-level summaries (generic and legal) with different
   compression ratios and evaluate their performance. The generic summaries
   present the overall description of the essential information of a
   document and legal summaries, produced by taking into account the
   domain-specific features that are present in the document. Next, we
   propose Boosting Okapi BM25 which is the modified model of Okapi BM25 to
   increase the efficiency of the LIR. We have evaluated proposed LIR
   approach in terms of MAP and R-precision and summarization approach
   using ROUGE tool on FIRE2013 and FIRE2014 datasets. To show the efficacy
   of the proposed system, we compare the experimental results with
   different IR models like PL2, In\_expB2, In\_expC2, InL2, DFR\_BM25,
   OkapiBM25 in terms of MAP. The experimental results of the proposed
   system show better performance than the existing various IR models in
   terms of various performance metrics. The empirical results also exhibit
   that the integration of text summarization and IR techniques helps in
   retrieving relevant information with less access time.}},

Abstract = {{Document retrieval from digital libraries based on user's query is
   highly affected by the terms appeared in the query. In many cases, there
   are some documents in the digital libraries that do not share exactly
   the same terms with the query, but they are related to the user's need.
   We address this challenge in this paper by introducing a new
   subject-based retrieval approach in which, apart from ranking documents
   based on the terms in the query, a new subject-based scoring scheme is
   defined between the query and a document. We define this score by
   introducing a new vector space model in which a vectorized subject-based
   representation is defined for each document and its keywords, and the
   terms in the query, as well. We have tested the new subject-based
   scoring scheme on a database of scientific papers obtained from Web of
   Science. Our Experimental results show that in 83\% of times users
   prefer the proposed scoring scheme with respect to the classic scoring
   ones.}},

Abstract = {{Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is one of the well-known searching
   techniques which match queries to documents in information retrieval
   applications. LSI has been proven to improve the retrieval performance,
   however, as the size of documents gets larger, current implementations
   are not fast enough to compute the result on a standard personal
   computer. In this paper, we proposed a new parallel LSI algorithm on
   standard personal computers with multicore processors to improve the
   performance of retrieving relevant documents. The proposed parallel LSI
   was designed to automatically run the matrix computation on LSI
   algorithms as parallel threads using multi-core processors. The
   Fork-Join technique is applied to execute the parallel programs. We used
   the Malay Translated Hadith of Shahih Bukhari from Jilid 1 until Jilid 4
   as the test collections. The total number of documents used is 2028 of
   text files. The processing time during the pre-processing phase of the
   documents for the proposed parallel LSI is measured and compared to the
   sequential LSI algorithm. Our results show that processing time for
   pre-processing tasks using our proposed parallel LSI system is faster
   than sequential system. Thus, our proposed parallel LSI algorithm has
   improved the searching time as compared to sequential LSI algorithm.}},

   systems require textual similarity measurement in order to function, and
   do so with the help of similarity measures. Similarity measures function
   differently, some measures which work better on highly similar texts do
   not always do so well on highly dissimilar texts. In this paper, we
   evaluated the performances of eight popular similarity measures on four
   levels (degree) of textual similarity using a corpus of plagiarised
   texts. The evaluation was carried out in the context of candidate
   selection for plagiarism detection. Performance was measured in terms of
   recall, and the best performed similarity measure(s) for each degree of
   textual similarity was identified. Results from our Experiments show
   that the performances of most of the measures were equal on highly
   similar texts, with the exception of Euclidean distance and
   Jensen-Shannon divergence which had poorer performances. Cosine
   similarity and Bhattacharryan coefficient performed best on lightly
   reviewed text, and on heavily reviewed texts, Cosine similarity and
   Pearson Correlation performed best and next best respectively. Pearson
   Correlation had the best performance on highly dissimilar texts. The
   results also show term weighing methods and n-gram document

Abstract = {{In recent years, more and more data have been generated via news media

   retrieval is the fundamental and important issue to search information
   under the scenario of ``Big Data{''}. Some recent works have proposed
   neural information retrieval, which has a significant improvement in
   terms of some problems (e.g., semantic gap). However, such retrieval
   takes a general-purposed query rather than event-oriented query as the
   retrieval object, which fails to search events in the event-oriented
   text retrieval scenario. As such, in this paper, we first analyze the
   difficulties and investigate a large of recent deep neural methods that
   may be used for event-oriented text retrieval. After that, we propose a
   pipeline based on deep neural networks. Finally, we present several
   tasks at different pipeline stages for evaluating event-oriented text

Abstract = {{In order to solve the problems of the existing Chinese full-text
   retrieval algorithms in terms of large data, for example, data structure
   is difficult to expand, not suitable for incremental index, and the
   retrieval efficiency is low. Based on the traditional inverted index
   structure, this paper proposes an index structure, which can support
   large data storage with extension ability and update in real time block
   linked-list index structure. Firstly, the new algorithm introduces the
   management concept of the block unit, the block unit is responsible for
   the management of the document set, and it creates an index for each
   term in the master index, then the index linked-list maps the term index
   and the block unit. This block linked-list index structure can greatly
   improve the ability of index expansion. Secondly, the main index and
   document index are both using the fixed-length storage with the same
   length, the positions of the terms' index information are both
   stationary in the master index file and the document index file of the
   block unit. According to the method, it can effectively solve the
   problems of the incremental index update and improve the update
   efficiency of the index. Finally, in the experiments, 350000 documents
   (about 1.46TB data) are randomly selected from the internet corpus
   (SogouT), which is used for comparing two index algorithms in three
   aspects, including the capability of initial datasets index creation,
   multitudinous files update and the retrieval of massive data sets. The
   results show that the new index algorithm has higher processing
   performance, especially in the efficiency of updating, with nearly 10\%
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{The research of Tolerance Rough Sets Model (TRSM) ever conducted acted
   in accordance with the rational approach of AI perspective. This article
   presented studies who complied with the contrary path, i.e. a cognitive

   retrieval system based on TRSM specifically for Indonesian. In addition
   to the proposed framework, this article proposes three methods based on
   TRSM, which are the automatic tolerance value generator, thesaurus
   optimization, and lexicon-based document representation. All methods
   were developed by the use of our own corpus, namely ICL-corpus, and
   evaluated by employing an available Indonesian corpus, called
   Kompas-corpus. The endeavor of a semantic information retrieval system
   is the effort to retrieve information and not merely terms with similar

Abstract = {{Image-text retrieval of natural scenes has been a popular research
   topic. Since image and text are heterogeneous cross-modal data, one of
   the key challenges is how to learn comprehensive yet unified
   representations to express the multi-modal data. A natural scene image
   mainly involves two kinds of visual concepts, objects and their
   relationships, which are equally essential to image-text retrieval.
   Therefore, a good representation should account for both of them. In the
   light of recent success of scene graph in many CV and NLP tasks for
   describing complex natural scenes, we propose to represent image and
   text with two kinds of scene graphs: visual scene graph (VSG) and
   textual scene graph (TSG), each of which is exploited to jointly
   characterize objects and relationships in the corresponding modality.
   The image-text retrieval task is then naturally formulated as
   cross-modal scene graph matching. Specifically, we design two particular
   scene graph encoders in our model for VSG and TSG, which can refine the
   representation of each node on the graph by aggregating neighborhood
   information. As a result, both object-level and relationship-level
   cross-modal features can be obtained, which favorably enables us to
   evaluate the similarity of image and text in the two levels in a more
   plausible way. We achieve state-ofthe-art results on Flickr30k and MS
   COCO, which verifies the advantages of our graph matching based approach
   for image-text retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of video-text retrieval that searches videos via
   natural language description or vice versa. Most state-of-the-art
   methods only consider cross-modal learning for two or three data points
   in isolation, ignoring to get benefit from the structural information of
   other data points from a global view. In this paper, we propose to
   exploit the comprehensive relationships among cross-modal samples via
   Graph Neural Networks (GNN). To improve the discriminative ability for
   accurately finding the positive sample, a Coarse-to-Fine GNN is
   constructed, which can progressively optimize the retrieval results via
   multi-step reasoning. Specifically, we first adopt heuristic edge
   features to represent relationships. Then we design a scoring module in
   each layer to rank the edges connected to the query node and drop the
   edges with lower scores. Finally, to alleviate the class imbalance
   issue, we propose a random-drop focal loss to optimize the whole
   framework. Extensive experimental results show that our method
   consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on four benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Automated text-retrieval-based bug localization (TRBL) techniques
   normally use the full text of a bug report to formulate a query and
   retrieve parts of the code that are buggy. Previous research has shown
   that reducing the size of the query increases the effectiveness of TRBL.
   On the other hand, researchers also found improvements when expanding
   the query (i.e., adding more terms). In this paper, we bring these two
   views together to reformulate queries for TRBL. Specifically, we improve
   discourse-based query reduction strategies, by adopting a combinatorial
   approach and using task phrases from bug reports, and combine them with
   a state-of-the-art query expansion technique, resulting in 970 query
   reformulation strategies. We investigate the benefits of these
   strategies for localizing buggy code elements and define a new approach,
   called QREX, based on the most effective strategy. We evaluated the
   reformulation strategies, including QREX, on 1,217 queries from
   different software systems to retrieve buggy code artifacts at three
   code granularities, using five state-of-the-art automated TRBL
   approaches. The results indicate that QREx increases TRBL effectiveness
   by 4\% - 12.6\%, compared to applying query reduction and expansion in
   isolation, and by 32.1\%, compared to the no-reformulation baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Text Retrieval (TR) approaches have been used to leverage the textual
   information contained in software artifacts to address a multitude of
   software engineering (SE) tasks. However, TR approaches need to be
   configured properly in order to lead to good results. Current approaches
   for automatic TR configuration in SE configure a single TR approach and
   then use it for all possible queries. In this paper, we show that such a
   configuration strategy leads to suboptimal results, and propose quest,
   the first approach bringing TR configuration selection to the query
   level. quest recommends the best TR configuration for a given query,
   based on a supervised learning approach that determines the TR
   configuration that performs the best for each query according to its
   properties. We evaluated quest in the context of feature and bug
   localization, using a data set with more than 1,000 queries. We found
   that quest is able to recommend one of the top three TR configurations
   for a query with a 69\% accuracy, on average. We compared the results
   obtained with the configurations recommended by quest for every query
   with those obtained using a single TR configuration for all queries in a
   system and in the entire data set. We found that using quest we obtain
   better results than with any of the considered TR configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical document retrieval systems play a vital role in biomedical
   question answering systems. The performance of the latter depends
   directly on the performance of its biomedical document retrieval
   section. Indeed, the main goal of biomedical document retrieval is to
   find a set of citations that have high probability to contain the
   answers. In this paper, we propose a biomedical document retrieval
   framework to retrieve the relevant documents for the biomedical
   questions ( queries) from the users. In our framework, we first use
   GoPubMed search engine to find the top-K results. Then, we re-rank the
   top-K results by computing the semantic similarity between questions and
   the title of each document using UMLS similarity. Our proposed framework
   is evaluated on the BioASQ 2014 task datasets. The experimental results
   show that our proposed framework has the best performance (MAP@ 100)
   compared to the existing state-of-the-art related document retrieval
   systems.}},

   different retrieval models designed for teaching, this study is the
   first to investigate how document-level features are associated with
   actual learning outcomes when users get results from a personalized
   learning-oriented retrieval algorithm. We also conduct what is, to our
   knowledge, the first crowdsourced longitudinal study of long-term
   learning retention, in which we gave a subset of users who participated
   in an initial learning and assessment study a delayed post-test
   approximately nine months later. With this data, we were able to analyze
   how the three retrieval conditions in the original study were associated
   with changes in long-term vocabulary knowledge. We found that while
   users who read the documents in the personalized retrieval condition had
   immediate learning gains comparable to the other two conditions, they
   had better long-term retention of more difficult vocabulary.}},

   vagueness analysis of data sets also including big data sets. Here we
   defined useful techniques like distance and similarity between two
   neutrosophic sets that have been applied to document classification in
   information retrieval. We define an innovative algorithm for classifying
   documents based on Euclidian distance between two neutrosophic sets.
   About 2500 documents in seven different categories are used for
   evaluation this new algorithm. Our experiments show that Neutrosophic
   Classification Algorithm achieved 95\% performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a novel approach to spoken document information
   retrieval for instinctive speech corpora. The conventional method for
   this problem is to make use of an Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR)
   integrated with the typical information retrieval method. However, ASRs
   tend to produce transcripts of spontaneous speech with momentous word
   error rate, which is a negative aspect of standard retrieval system. To
   prevail over such a constraint, we propose a method for spoken document
   retrieval based on spoken keyword spotting using Auto Associative Neural
   Networks (AANN). The proposed work concerns the exploit of the
   distribution capturing capability of an auto associative neural network
   for spoken keyword detection. It involves sliding a frame-based keyword
   template along the audio documents and by means of confidence score
   acquired from the normalized squared error of AANN to competently search
   for a match. This work provides a new spoken keyword spotting algorithm
   based spoken documents clustering. The experimental results recommend
   that the proposed method is promising for retrieving relevant documents
   of a spoken query as a key.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose State-of-the-art cloud applications are problematic for
   collaborative document management; their current design does not
   encourage active personal folder categorization. Cloud applications such
   as Google Drive and Microsoft's OneDrive store documents automatically,
   so at no point are users directed to categorize them by placing them in
   folders. To encourage active categorization and promote effective
   retrieval of cloud documents, the authors designed an add-on ``nudge{''}
   called Personal Organizer which prompts Google Drive users to categorize
   by storing cloud documents in personal folders. The add-on prompt is
   triggered when users attempt to close uncategorized or unnamed
   documents. The purpose of this paper is to test whether using the
   Personal Organizer add-on leads participants to actively store their
   documents in folders that they personally created, and whether this
   promotes more successful and efficient retrieval.
   Design/methodology/approach To test the add-on, the authors conducted a
   pretest-manipulation-post-test intervention study with 34 participants
   lasting over three months. In both tests, participants were asked to
   retrieve personal documents taken from their own ``Recents{''} list to
   improve ecological validity. Findings Using our add-on doubled the
   percentage of documents that were actively stored in folders.
   Additionally, using personally created folders substantially improved
   retrieval success while decreasing retrieval time. Originality/value
   Implementing our findings can improve document storage and retrieval for
   millions of users of collaborative cloud storage. The authors discuss
   broader theoretical implications concerning the role of active
   organization for retrieval in collaborative repositories, as well as
   design implications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new computational backend model that supports
   Arabic document information retrieval (ADIR) as a dataset and OCR
   services. Therefore, different services that support document analysis,
   retrieving, processing including dataset preparation, and recognition
   will be discussed. Consequently, ADIR services provide general functions
   of the Arabic OCR to compose many other services in the OCR domain.
   Furthermore, the proposed work can provide accessing different methods
   of document layout analysis with a platform where they can share and
   handle such methods (services) without any setup requirements. One of
   the used datasets composed from 16,800 Arabic letters written by 60
   writers. Each writer wrote each letter from Alif to Ya 10 times in two
   forms. The forms were scanned at 300 DPI resolution and are segmented in
   two sets: training set with 13,440 letters for 48 images per class
   label, and testing set with 3,360 letters to 120 images per class label
   Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used and adapted for Arabic
   handwritten letters classification. In an experimental test, we showed
   that our results outperform 100\% classification accuracy rate on
   testing images. Therefore, the ADIR services provide a ``service
   description{''}, which includes an interface and a server's URL. The
   interface allows communication process between clients and services.
   Although, in this article we evaluate IR results and compared them with
   respect to corrected equivalent.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The multinomial language model has been one of the most effective models
   of retrieval for more than a decade. However, the multinomial
   distribution does not model one important linguistic phenomenon relating
   to term dependency-that is, the tendency of a term to repeat itself
   within a document (i.e., word burstiness). In this article, we model
   document generation as a random process with reinforcement (a
   multivariate Polya process) and develop a Dirichlet compound multinomial
   language model that captures word burstiness directly.
   We show that the new reinforced language model can be computed as
   efficiently as current retrieval models, and with experiments on an
   extensive set of TREC collections, we show that it significantly
   outperforms the state-of-the-art language model for a number of standard
   effectiveness metrics. Experiments also show that the tuning parameter
   in the proposed model is more robust than that in the multinomial
   language model. Furthermore, we develop a constraint for the verbosity
   hypothesis and show that the proposed model adheres to the constraint.
   Finally, we show that the new language model essentially introduces a
   measure closely related to idf, which gives theoretical justification
   for combining the term and document event spaces in tf-idf type schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Twitter is one of the major social media platforms today to study human
   behaviours by analysing their interactions. To ensure popularity of the
   tweet, the focus should be on the content of the tweet that results in
   numerous followings of that message with sufficient number of likes and
   retweets. The high quality of tweets, increases the online reputation of
   the users who post it. If a user can get the prediction of likes and
   retweets on his text before posting it on the internet, it would improve
   the popularity of the tweet from information sharing perspective. In
   this paper we employed different machine learning classifiers like SVM,
   Nave Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network, on
   top of two different text processing approaches used in NLP (natural
   language processing), namely bag-of-words (TFIDF) and word embeddings
   (Doc2Vec), to check how many likes and retweets can a tweet generate.
   The results obtained indicate that all the models performed 10-15\%

Abstract = {{Information retrieval systems are more and more popular due to the
   information overload in the Internet. There are many problems that can
   cause this situation: user can not know his real information need when
   he submits a few words to the browser; these words can have many
   different meanings; user can expect different results depending on
   current context. To obtain satisfactory result, the retrieval system
   should save user profile and develop it. In this paper we propose a
   method for determining user profile based on content-based and
   collaborative filtering. Our approach uses Bayesian Networks to develop
   representative profile of the users' group. We have performed some
   experiments to evaluate the quality of proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing complexity of architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) projects and fast track execution of project works,
   written documents are becoming more and more important for project
   coordination, communication, and works control. Finding all the relevant
   information from unstructured construction documents is critical to
   various management tasks such as work planning, progress control, and
   claims. A framework is proposed in this research to retrieve
   project-wide as-needed information from AEC documents. Through this
   framework, improvement in the levels of precision and recall in the
   information retrieval process can be made effective through the use of a
   project-specific term dictionary and dependency grammar parsing
   information of textual documents. Their effectiveness is demonstrated
   through a series of experimental tests conducted on a real life building
   redevelopment project with different information retrieval and ranking
   strategies. The results and findings are presented in this paper along
   with discussion on the related issues on research and system
   development. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The continuing growth of information overflow has made it hard to obtain
   valuable information on the web. In this trend, the need for effective
   Information Retrieval (IR) technique has been increased. Although
   document data contain much more abundant information, users can retrieve
   necessary information only from the title and description in
   conventional web services. In order to meet the demands for fast and
   accurate retrieval of valuable information, we propose a fast and
   effective content-based document information retrieval system that
   retrieves the information from the actual content of a document. The
   proposed method is based on a topic model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   that is used to extract major keywords for a given document. The main
   contributions of our system are the increased flexibility,
   effectiveness, and fast retrieval of information. Our system can easily
   communicate with existing web service through the standard JSON format.
   In addition, we increase the speed of information retrieval by using
   NoSQL based database system with inverted indexing and B-tree based
   indexing. We validate the performance of our system on real data
   collected from the SlideShare service. The proposed system shows better
   retrieval performance over the existing IR system.}},

Abstract = {{Information retrieval systems are generally used to find documents that
   are most appropriate according to some query that comes dynamically from
   users. In this paper a novel Fuzzy Document based Information Retrieval
   Model (FDIRM) is proposed for the purpose of Stock Market Index
   forecasting. The novelty of proposed approach is a modified tf-idf
   scoring scheme to predict the future trend of the stock market index.
   The contribution of this paper has two dimensions, 1) In the proposed
   system the simple time series is converted to an enriched fuzzy
   linguistic time series with a unique approach of incorporating market
   sentiment related information along with the price and 2) A unique
   approach is followed while modeling the information retrieval (IR)
   system which converts a simple IR system into a forecasting system. From
   the performance comparison of FDIRM with standard benchmark models it
   can be affirmed that the proposed model has a potential of becoming a
   good forecasting model. The stock market data provided by Standard \&
   Poor's CRISIL NSE Index 50 (CNX NIFTY-50 index) of National Stock
   Exchange of India (NSE) is used to experiment and validate the proposed
   model. The authentic data for validation and experimentation is obtained
   from http://www.nseindia.com which is the official website of NSE. A
   java program is under construction to implement the model in real-time
   with graphical users' interface.}},

Abstract = {{The document indexing is a fairly sensitive phase in the information
   retrieval. However, terms presented in a document are not sufficient to
   completely represent it. Then, the exploitation of the implicit
   information, through external resources, is necessary for better
   indexing. For this purpose, a new indexing model for biomedical
   documents based on description logics has been proposed to generate
   relevant indexes. The documents and the external resource are
   represented by descriptive expressions; a first statistical phase
   consists in assigning an importance degree to each term in the document
   and a semantic part to extract the most important concepts of the MESH
   thesaurus (Medical Subject Headings). The concept extraction step uses
   the description logics to combine the statistical and semantic
   approaches followed by a cleaning part to select the most important
   indexes for the document representation. For the experiments phase we
   used the OHSUMED collection, which showed the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach and the importance of using description logics for the
   indexing process.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) has grabbed the major
   attention of the information retrieval community. TIR exploits the
   temporal dynamics in the information retrieval process and harnesses
   both textual relevance and temporal relevance to fulfill the temporal
   information requirements of a user Ur Rehman Khan et al., 2018. The
   focus time of document is an important temporal aspect which is defined
   as the time to which the content of the document refers Jatowt et al.,
   2015; Jatowt et al., 2013; Morbidoni et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2018. To
   the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any standard benchmark
   data set (publicly available) that holds the potential to
   comprehensively evaluate the performance of focus time assessment
   strategies. Considering these aspects, we have produced the
   Event-dataset, which is comprised of 35 queries and set of news articles
   for each query. Such that, C = \{Q(S) ,Q(S)\} where C represents the
   dataset, Q(S) is query set Q(S) = \{q(1), q(2) , q(3),...., q(35)\} and
   for each there is a set of news articles q(i) = \{d(r), d(nr)\}. d(r),
   d(nr) are sets of relevant documents and non-relevant documents
   respectively. Each query in the dataset represents a popular event. To
   annotate these articles into relevant and non-relevant, we have employed
   a user-study based evaluation method wherein a group of postgraduate
   students manually annotate the articles into the aforementioned
   categories. We believe that the generation of such dataset can provide
   an opportunity for the information retrieval researchers to use it as a
   benchmark to evaluate focus time assessment methods specifically and
   information retrieval methods generically. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Most of existing sparse CCA algorithms compute sparse weight vectors by
   minimizing the l(1) norm, which imposes essential difficulty for the
   analysis of the solution. Different from existing ones, this paper
   develops a novel sparse CCA algorithm by l(0) penalty. The resulting
   l(0) minimization problem is solved by means of residual, which has one
   merit that no regularization parameter or shrinkage parameter needs to
   be tuned. We also provide consistency analysis of the proposed method
   using the concept of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition, while
   no theoretical guarantee was given for most of existing sparse CCA
   methods. Sparsity bound of the CCA solutions is also studied.
   Experimental results on both simulated dataset and real-world datasets
   in cross-language document retrieval task demonstrate the effectiveness
   and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm, when compared with
   several state-of-the-art sparse CCA methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Semantic information retrieval system for text documents aims at
   retrieving text documents containing the similar semantic representation
   to the query. Semantic representation of text can be vector or
   dependency graph depending on the approach of semantic analysis. This
   paper proposes a model of semantic information retrieval for Vietnamese
   to retrieve similar texts to a query. In the proposed system, the
   semantic analysis is to identify the semantic dependency graph of
   sentences and the retrieving process computes the relevance of text
   document with these semantic dependency graphs. For identifying the
   semantic dependency graph of a sentence, the transformation rules are
   studied to apply on dependency parse using lexicon ontology for
   Vietnamese. For ranking retrieval results, the Jaccard-Tanimoto distance
   is applied to the ranking function. The evaluation shows that the
   proposed model has higher MAP (0.4045) than MAP of BM25 model (0.3825)
   and of TF.IDF model (0.3688).}},

Journal = {{BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{307-317}},
Abstract = {{Presented work outlines the text classification system developed with
   appropriate four main modules and the algorithm of the text
   classification for the Georgian Language. The Heuristic Analysis is used
   to develop the concept-pattern describing appropriate class in a
   document collection and a new algorithm was developed and applied to get
   the set of term classes for every detected stem. The TF-IDF (Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scheme for term weight calculation
   is performed. The novelty of the method is that one generalized concept
   is created on the basis of each category of the documents sourcing the
   whole database. The generalized concept contains all high weight terms
   along with the terms not to be presented in the definition of the
   concept, so the concept contains information what terms are efficient
   for the class and what terms ``should not{''} be present (not to contain
   the defined term is a characteristics itself). The generalized concept
   pattern, based on the above mentioned scheme, is compared to the
   patterns (high weight term set) formed for each document.
   The system was tested on Georgian text based on 900 documents collected
   from 6 categories (classes - 150 documents in each). Using the
   generalized concept formation method the accuracy was increased by 11\%
   and recall by 10 \%, compared to k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN). On
   the basis of the received results we may conclude that the patterns
   constructed with the help of Analytical Heuristics method used for
   retrieval is quite promising and future modifications for better results
   are possible.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that distributed databases (DDB) have become a
   requirement of users and real-world applications, these DDBs are still
   too far from the performance of centralized DBs that have shown
   efficiency and robustness with their native search engines. Indeed, DDB
   couldnt benefit from textual search engines because of the timing issue
   in the distributed context and keeping data integrity among the
   distributed architecture. As a contribution in this research field, we
   propose in this paper, a new technology for indexing DDB based on the
   Lucene indexing engine. We prove that this technology allows, in
   addition to textual search, 1) the transparency of distributed
   architectures scaling {[}8] and external search indexes, 2) the
   optimization of the exchange protocol data between nodes, 3) the
   synchronous processing of insertion, deletion or failure of a node of

Abstract = {{A method for information retrieval based on annotated suffix trees (AST)
   is presented. The method is based on a string-to-document relevance
   score calculated using AST as well as fragment reverse indexing for
   improving performance. We developed a search engine based on the method.
   This engine is compared with some other popular text aggregating
   techniques: probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSA) and latent
   Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
   We used real data for computation experiments: an online store's
   xml-catalogs and collections of web pages ( both in Russian) and a real
   user's queries from the Yandex. Wordstat service. As quality metrics, we
   used point quality estimations and graphical representations. Our
   AST-based method generally leads to results that are similar to those
   obtained by the other methods. However, in the case of inaccurate
   queries, AST-based results are superior. The speed of the AST-based
   method is slightly worse than the speed of the PLSA/LDA-based methods.
   Due to the observed correlation between the average query performing
   time and the string lengths at the AST construction phase, one can
   improve the performance of the algorithm by dividing the texts into
   smaller fragments at the preprocessing stage. However, the quality of
   search may suffer if the fragments are too short. Therefore, the
   applicability of annotated suffix tree techniques for text retrieval
   problems is demonstrated. Moreover, the AST-based method has significant
   advantages in the case of fuzzy search.}},

Abstract = {{Text Retrieval (TR)-based approaches for bug localization rely on
   formulating an initial query based on a bug report. Often, the query
   does not return the buggy software artifacts at or near the top of the
   list (i.e., it is a low-quality query). In such cases, the query needs
   reformulation. Existing research on supporting developers in the
   reformulation of queries focuses mostly on leveraging relevance feedback
   from the user or expanding the original query with additional
   information (e.g., adding synonyms). In many cases, the problem with
   such low-quality queries is the presence of irrelevant terms (i.e.,
   noise) and previous research has shown that removing such terms from the
   queries leads to substantial improvement in code retrieval.
   Unfortunately, the current state of research lacks methods to identify
   the irrelevant terms. Our research aims at addressing this problem and
   our conjecture is that reducing a low-quality query to only the terms
   describing the Observed Behavior (OB) can improve TR-based bug
   localization. To verify our conjecture, we conducted an empirical study
   using bug data from 21 open source systems to reformulate 451
   low-quality queries. We compare the accuracy achieved by four TR-based
   bug localization approaches at three code granularities (i.e., files,
   classes, and methods), when using the complete bug reports as queries
   versus a reduced version corresponding to the OB only. The results show
   that the reformulated queries improve TR-based bug localization for all
   approaches by 147.4\% and 116.6\% on average, in terms of MRR and MAP,
   respectively. We conclude that using the OB descriptions is a simple and
   effective technique to reformulate low-quality queries during TR-based
   bug localization.}},

Abstract = {{Constructing a joint representation invariant across different
   modalities (e.g., video, language) is of significant importance in many
   multimedia applications. While there are a number of recent successes in
   developing effective image-text retrieval methods by learning joint
   representations, the video-text retrieval task, however, has not been
   explored to its fullest extent. In this paper, we study how to
   effectively utilize available multimodal cues from videos for the
   cross-modal video-text retrieval task. Based on our analysis, we propose
   a novel framework that simultaneously utilizes multi-modal features
   (different visual characteristics, audio inputs, and text) by a fusion
   strategy for efficient retrieval. Furthermore, we explore several loss
   functions in training the embedding and propose a modified pairwise
   ranking loss for the task. Experiments on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets
   demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gain
   compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Text Retrieval (TR)-based approaches for bug localization rely on
   formulating an initial query based on the full text of a bug report.
   When the query fails to retrieve the buggy code artifacts, developers
   can reformulate the query and retrieve more candidate code documents.
   Existing research on query reformulation focuses mostly on leveraging
   relevance feedback from the user or on expanding the original query with
   additional information. We hypothesize that the title of the bug
   reports, the observed behavior, expected behavior, steps to reproduce,
   and code snippets provided by the users in bug descriptions, contain the
   most relevant information for retrieving the buggy code artifacts, and
   that other parts of the descriptions contain more irrelevant terms,
   which hinder retrieval. This paper proposes and evaluates a set of query
   reformulation strategies based on the selection of existing information
   in bug descriptions, and the removal of irrelevant parts from the
   original query. The results show that selecting the bug report title and
   the observed behavior is the strategy that performs best across various
   TR-based bug localization approaches and code granularities, as it leads
   to retrieving the buggy code artifacts within the top-N results for
   25.6\% more queries (on average) than without query reformulation. This
   strategy is highly applicable and consistent across different thresholds
   N. Selecting the steps to reproduce or the expected behavior (when
   provided in the bug reports) along with the bug title and the observed
   behavior leads to higher performance (i.e., between 31.4\% and 41.7\%
   more queries) and comparable consistency, yet it is applicable in fewer
   cases. These reformulation strategies are easy to use and are
   independent of the underlying retrieval technique.}},

Title = {{Predicting Query Quality for Applications of Text Retrieval to Software
   Engineering Tasks}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Context: Since the mid-2000s, numerous recommendation systems based on
   text retrieval (TR) have been proposed to support software engineering
   (SE) tasks such as concept location, traceability link recovery, code
   reuse, impact analysis, and so on. The success of TR-based solutions
   highly depends on the query submitted, which is either formulated by the
   developer or automatically extracted from software artifacts.
   Aim: We aim at predicting the quality of queries submitted to TR-based
   approaches in SE. This can lead to benefits for developers and for the
   quality of software systems alike. For example, knowing when a query is
   poorly formulated can save developers the time and frustration of
   analyzing irrelevant search results. Instead, they could focus on
   reformulating the query. Also, knowing if an artifact used as a query
   leads to irrelevant search results may uncover underlying problems in
   the query artifact itself.
   Method: We introduce an automatic query quality prediction approach for
   software artifact retrieval by adapting NL-inspired solutions to their
   use on software data. We present two applications and evaluations of the
   approach in the context of concept location and traceability link
   recovery, where TR has been applied most often in SE. For concept
   location, we use the approach to determine if the list of retrieved code
   elements is likely to contain code relevant to a particular change
   request or not, in which case, the queries are good candidates for
   reformulation. For traceability link recovery, the queries represent
   software artifacts. In this case, we use the query quality prediction
   approach to identify artifacts that are hard to trace to other artifacts
   and may therefore have a low intrinsic quality for TR-based traceability
   link recovery.
   Results: For concept location, the evaluation shows that our approach is
   able to correctly predict the quality of queries in 82\% of the cases,
   on average, using very little training data. In the case of traceability
   recovery, the proposed approach is able to detect hard to trace
   artifacts in 74\% of the cases, on average.
   Conclusions: The results of our evaluation on applications for concept
   location and traceability link recovery indicate that our approach can
   be used to predict the results of a TR-based approach by assessing the
   quality of the text query. This can lead to saved effort and time, as
   well as the identification of software artifacts that may be difficult
   to trace using TR.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of image-text matching in order to
   make the image and text have better semantic matching. In the previous
   work, people just simply used the pre-training network to extract image
   and text features and project directly into a common subspace, or change
   various loss functions on this basis, or use the attention mechanism to
   directly match the image region proposals and the text phrases. This is
   not a good match for the semantics of the image and the text. In this
   study, we propose a method of cross-media retrieval based on global
   representation and local representation. We constructed a cross-media
   two-level network to explore better semantic matching between images and
   text, which contains subnets that handle both global and local features.
   Specifically, we not only use the self-attention network to obtain a
   macro representation of the global image but also use the local
   fine-grained patch with the attention mechanism. Then, we use a
   two-level alignment framework to promote each other to learn different
   representations of cross-media retrieval. The innovation of this study
   lies in the use of more comprehensive features of image and text to
   design the two kinds of similarity and add them up in some way.
   Experimental results show that this method is effective in image-text
   retrieval. Experimental results on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets
   show that this model has a better recall rate than many of the current
   advanced cross-media retrieval models.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-modal retrieval using deep neural networks aims to retrieve
   relevant data between the two different modalities. The performance of
   cross-modal retrieval is still unsatisfactory for two problems. First,
   most of the previous methods failed to incorporate the common knowledge
   among modalities when predicting the item representations. Second, the
   semantic relationships indicated by class label are still insufficiently
   utilized, which is an important clue for inferring similarities between
   the cross modal items. To address the above issues, we propose a novel
   cross memory network with pair discrimination (CMPD) for image-text
   cross modal retrieval, where the main contributions lie in two-folds.
   First, we propose the cross memory as a set of latent concepts to
   capture the common knowledge among different modalities. It is learnable
   and can be fused into each modality through attention mechanism, which
   aims to discriminatively predict representations. Second, we propose the
   pair discrimination loss to discriminate modality labels and class
   labels of item pairs, which can efficiently capture the semantic
   relationships among these modality labels and class labels.
   Comprehensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the
   state-of-the-art approaches in image-text retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, more and more Internet users use the cloud storage services to
   store their personal data, especially when the mobile devices which have
   limited storage capacity popularize. With the cloud storage services,
   the users can access their personal data at any time and anywhere
   without storing the data at local. However, the cloud storage service
   provider is not completely trusted. Therefore, the first concern of
   using cloud storage services is the data security. A straightforward
   method to address the security problem is to encrypt the data before
   uploading to the cloud server. The encryption method is able to keep the
   data secret from the cloud server, but cloud server also can not
   manipulate the data after encryption. It will greatly undermine the
   advantage of the cloud storage. For example, a user encrypts his
   personal data before uploading them to the cloud. When he wants to
   access some data at the cloud, he has to download all the data and
   decrypt them. Obviously, this service mode will incur the huge overheads
   of communication and computation. Several related works have been
   proposed to enable the search over the encrypted data, but all of them
   only support the encrypted keyword search. In this paper, we propose a
   new full-text retrieval algorithm over the encrypted data for the
   scenario of cloud storage, in which all the words in a document have
   been extracted and built a privacy-preserved full-text retrieval index.
   Based on the privacy-preserved full-text retrieval index, cloud server
   can execute full-text retrieval over the large scale encrypted
   documents. The numerical analysis and experimental results further
   validate the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm.}},

   generated from bug reports of nine open source systems. Removing the
   terms leads to substantial improvement in retrieval: 73\% of the queries
   are improved, leading to 21.8\% and 13.4\% gain in terms of MRR and MAP,
   respectively. Such improvement is larger than that of many more
   sophisticated state-of-theart approaches. The results show promise and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a framework for learning a joint embedding

   frame-sentence view and the other is a region-phrase view. In the
   frame-sentence view, we project each frame of the images and each
   sentence of the texts into a holistic-level subspace to explore the
   correlation between them. In the region-phrase view, we extract each
   region of the frames and each phrase of the sentences and map them into
   a local-level subspace. We separately mine the semantic correlations in
   the two views, then merge them by a multi-view fusion ranking method. In
   each view, to embed heterogeneous data into a common space, we adopt the
   two-branch neural network to transform the data. Extensive experiments
   show that our multi-view joint space can preserve more accurate semantic
   correlations between images and texts in different granularities and can
   significantly improve the performance on the image-text retrieval task.

   we propose a novel text feature representation model, which integrates

   generative probabilistic model of a corpus, and texts are organized as
   random mixtures of latent topics. In particular, the proposed algorithm
   computes the distance between document and topics, and then each
   document is represented as a feature vector, in which each dimension
   denotes the distance between this document and a specific topic. To test
   the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, several related methods are
   made performance comparison, and experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed solution performs better than other methods, and it can

   number of relevant documents retrieved by the search. This paper
   proposes a representation of the documents and queries for QbESDR based
   on combining different-sized phone n-grams obtained from automatic
   transcriptions, namely phone multigram representation. Since phone
   transcriptions usually have errors, several hypotheses for the query
   transcriptions are combined in order to ease the impact of these errors.
   The proposed system stores the document in inverted indices, which leads
   to fast and efficient search. Different combinations of the phone
   multigram strategy with a state-of-art system based on pattern matching
   using dynamic time warping (DTW) are proposed: one consists in a
   two-stage system that intends to be as effective but more efficient than
   a DTW-based system, while the other aims at improving the performance
   achieved by these two systems by combining their output scores.
   Experiments performed on the MediaEval 2014 Query-by-Example Search on
   Speech (QUESST 2014) evaluation framework suggest that the phone
   multigram representation for QbESDR is a successful approach, and the
   assessed combinations with a DTW-based strategy lead to more efficient
   and effective QbESDR systems. In addition, the phone multigram approach
   succeeded in increasing the detection of non-exact matches of the
   queries.}},

   information retrieval}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING}},
Abstract = {{Information retrieval is defining a structured knowledge from
   unstructured resource that satisfies the information needed from large
   collection of resources. document information retrieval (DIR) confines
   the resources in terms of documents where the term resource implicate
   text, audio, video, image and so on. In this paper, an advanced analysis
   in the field of Data Mining with Evolutionary concept is addressed
   namely DIR using ant colony optimization. The model consists of fuzzy
   C-means clustering and frequency set mining procedures to extract the
   information from the documents as pre-processing segments in the first
   phase. In the second phase, ant colony optimization is used to explore
   the document space in an intelligent manner to extract knowledge from
   it. Initially the documents are pre-processed, and a cluster is formed
   among the documents based on the pre-processed information. Later ants
   are used to explore each cluster in an intensive manner. The proposed
   model is evaluated with three different range of which can be classified
   as small, medium, and large sizes of documents from online sources. The
   results prove the significance of the proposed model when compared with
   the existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, one major research direction of information
   retrieval includes user behaviour prediction. For that reason many
   models have been proposed aiming at the accurate evaluation of
   information retrieval systems and the best prediction of web search
   users' behaviour. In this paper we propose a new evaluation metric for
   information retrieval systems which employs two relevance factors; a
   relevance judgement grade and a popularity grade that represents users'
   vote for a document. We show that this new metric performs better than
   other evaluation metrics when expressing user behaviour. Moreover, in
   order to test the performance of our metric on different and scalable
   ranking algorithms, we develop a pairwise text similarity algorithm
   using cosine similarity, implemented on the MapReduce model, and then
   perform experiments on rankings generated by the algorithm. (C) 2016

   methods allow the user to formulate a query through keywords. However,
   there are situations where the user has only one example document and

   in a collection. This paper proposes an IR method that receives as input
   a query document and retrieves the k most similar documents to the query
   document using a representation based on Maximal Frequent Sequences

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to a new method that uses combined technique of

   Information Retrieval (IR) system which uses cosine similarity technique
   to retrieve and rank documents and a multilingual module using
   dictionary based translation where the tf-idf values are calculated and
   stored in inverted index which is term based index. The threshold value
   is used as a selection medium for documents which reduces the search
   space of index reducing the overall time for retrieval. A Query
   Expansion (QE) module is added in to the said system. The aim is to use
   QE to overcome the limitations of dictionary based translation, and to
   retrieve more relevant results. The system is validated with several
   measures, which shows the difference in the result before expansion and
   after expansion.}},

   based on the full content coordinating of keywords, which lack the
   semantic data. In this paper the semantic based information retrieval
   methodology is proposed to get data from the web archives in a specific
   domain by gathering the domain relevant information with web crawler. By
   utilizing ontology and semantic information matched with a given user's
   query is used for retrieval. The results are discussed for retrieving
   attractive tourist places in a particular city. Analyses are carried out
   by comparing results obtained with and without wordnet, with ontology
   and both ontology and wordnet respectively. The analysis carried out
   reveals that the proposed system is working efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{The experiments presented in this paper were aimed at the selection of
   documents to be used in the blind or pseudo relevance feedback in spoken
   document retrieval. The previous experiments with the automatic
   selection of the relevant documents for the blind relevance feedback
   method have shown the possibilities of the dynamical selection of the
   relevant documents for each query depending on the content of the
   retrieved documents instead of just blindly defining the number of the
   relevant documents to be used in advance. The score normalization
   techniques commonly used in the speaker identification task are used for
   the dynamical selection of the relevant documents. In the previous
   experiments, the language modeling information retrieval method was
   used. In the experiments presented in this paper, we have derived the
   score normalization technique also for the vector space information
   retrieval method. The results of our experiments show, that these
   normalization techniques are not method-dependent and can be
   successfully used in several information retrieval system settings.}},

Abstract = {{Most current chatbot engines are designed to reply to user utterances
   based on existing utterance-response (or Q-R)1 pairs. In this paper, we
   present DocChat, a novel information retrieval approach for chatbot
   engines that can leverage unstructured documents, instead of Q-R pairs,
   to respond to utterances. A learning to rank model with features
   designed at different levels of granularity is proposed to measure the
   relevance between utterances and responses directly. We evaluate our
   proposed approach in both English and Chinese: (i) For English, we
   evaluate DocChat on WikiQA and QASent, two answer sentence selection
   tasks, and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Reasonable
   improvements and good adaptability are observed. (ii) For Chinese, we
   compare DocChat with Xiaolce(2), a famous chitchat engine in China, and
   side-by-side evaluation shows that DocChat is a perfect complement for
   chatbot engines using Q-R pairs as main source of responses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a probabilistic document ranking model incorporating
   term dependencies. Document ranking is a fundamental information
   retrieval task. The task is to sort documents in a collection according
   to the relevance to the user query (Qin et al., Information Retrieval
   Journal, 13, 346-374, 2010). A probabilistic model is a model for
   computing the conditional probability of the relevance of each document
   given query. Most of the widely used models assume the term independence
   because it is challenging to compute the joint probabilities of multiple
   terms. Words in natural language texts are obviously highly correlated.
   In this paper, we assume a multinomial distribution model to calculate
   the relevance probability of a document by considering the dependency
   structure of words, and propose an information retrieval model to rank a
   document by estimating the probability with the maximum entropy method.
   The results of the ranking simulation experiment in various multinomial
   situations show better retrieval results than a model that assumes the
   independence of words. The results of document ranking experiments using
   real-world datasets LETOR OHSUMED also show better retrieval results.}},

   the second method, the latent Dirichlet allocation model is expanded to
   deal with relevant query terms. The topic of each term within a given
   document may be sampled using either the normal document-specific
   mixture weights in LDA using query-specific mixture weights. We also
   developed an efficient method based on the Gibbs sampling technique for

Abstract = {{Creating systematic reviews is a painstaking task undertaken especially
   in domains where experimental results are the primary method to
   knowledge creation. For the review authors, analysing documents to
   extract relevant data is a demanding activity. To support the creation
   of systematic reviews, we have created DASyR-a semi-automatic document
   analysis system. DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers
   for the purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries
   are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic
   annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing,
   followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the
   annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a
   subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation
   domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies
   makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR
   through experimental results for different parameter values for the
   bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error
   rate, precision and recall.}},

Abstract = {{In competitive search settings as the Web, there is an ongoing ranking
   competition between document authors (publishers) for certain queries.
   The goal is to have documents highly ranked, and the means is document
   manipulation applied in response to rankings. Existing retrieval models,
   and their theoretical underpinnings (e.g., the probability ranking
   principle), do not account for post-ranking corpus dynamics driven by
   this strategic behavior of publishers. However, the dynamics has major
   effect on retrieval effectiveness since it affects content availability
   in the corpus. Furthermore, while manipulation strategies observed over
   the Web were reported in past literature, they were not analyzed as
   ongoing, and changing, post-ranking response strategies, nor were they
   connected to the foundations of classical ad hoc retrieval models (e.g.,
   content-based document-query surface level similarities and document
   relevance priors). We present a novel theoretical and empirical analysis
   of the strategic behavior of publishers using these foundations.
   Empirical analysis of controlled ranking competitions that we organized
   reveals a key strategy of publishers: making their documents (gradually)
   become similar to documents ranked the highest in previous rankings. Our
   theoretical analysis of the ranking competition as a repeated game, and
   its minmax regret equilibrium, yields a result that supports the merits
   of this publishing strategy. We further show that it can be predicted
   with high accuracy, and without explicit knowledge of the ranking
   function, whether documents will be promoted to the highest rank in our
   competitions. The prediction utilizes very few features which quantify
   changes of documents, specifically with respect to those previously
   ranked the highest.}},

Abstract = {{Query expansion (QE) is an important process in information retrieval
   applications that improves the user query and helps in retrieving
   relevant results. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid query expansion
   model (HQE) that investigates how external resources can be combined to
   association rules mining and used to enhance expansion terms generation
   and selection. The HQE model can be processed in different
   configurations, starting from methods based on association rules and
   combining it with external knowledge. The HQE model handles the two main
   phases of a QE process, namely: the candidate terms generation phase and
   the selection phase. We propose for the first phase, statistical,
   semantic and conceptual methods to generate new related terms for a
   given query. For the second phase, we introduce a similarity measure,
   ESAC, based on the Explicit Semantic Analysis that computes the
   relatedness between a query and the set of candidate terms. The
   performance of the proposed HQE model is evaluated within two
   experimental validations. The first one addresses the tweet search task
   proposed by TREC Microblog Track 2011 and an ad-hoc IR task related to
   the hard topics of the TREC Robust 2004. The second experimental
   validation concerns the tweet contextualization task organized by INEX
   2014. Global results highlighted the effectiveness of our HQE model and
   of association rules mining for QE combined with external resources.}},

   those, being important sources of information due to all the curated

   the search of information a challenging task. To surpass that,
   Biomedical text mining (BioTM) creates methodologies to search and
   structure that data. Several BioTM techniques can be applied to patents.
   From those, Information Retrieval is the process where relevant data is
   obtained from collections of documents. In this work, a patent pipeline
   was developed and integrated into @Note2, an open-source computational
   framework for BioTM. This integration allows to run further BioTM tools

Abstract = {{Despite the broad adoption of both Apache Spark and Apache Solr, there
   is little integration between these two platforms to support scalable,
   end-to-end text analytics. We believe this is a missed opportunity, as
   there is substantial synergy in building analytical pipelines where the
   results of potentially complex faceted queries feed downstream text
   processing components. This demonstration explores exactly such an
   integration: we evaluate performance under different analytical
   scenarios and present three simple case studies that illustrate the
   range of possible analyses enabled by seamlessly connecting Spark to
   Solr.}},

Abstract = {{Graphs have been widely used as modeling tools in Natural Language
   Processing (NLP), Text Mining (TM) and Information Retrieval (IR).
   Traditionally, the unigram bag-of-words representation is applied; that
   way, a document is represented as a multiset of its terms, disregarding
   dependencies between the terms. Although several variants and extensions
   of this modeling approach have been proposed, the main weakness comes
   from the underlying term independence assumption; the order of the terms
   within a document is completely disregarded and any relationship between
   terms is not taken into account in the final task. To deal with this
   problem, the research community has explored various representations,
   and to this direction, graphs constitute a well-developed model for text
   representation. The goal of this tutorial is to offer a comprehensive
   presentation of recent methods that rely on graph-based text
   representations to deal with various tasks in Text Mining, NLP and IR.}},

Abstract = {{Text Matching is the task of examining two pieces of texts, such as
   query and documents, and determining whether they have the same meaning.
   Text Matching is very important in many NLP tasks, such as document
   retrieval, question answering, automatic conversation, machine
   translation, etc. In recent years, there existed some
   representation-based and interaction-based neural networks which have
   achieved some improvements. However powerful attention mechanism is
   rarely used in these models. Inspired by the success of attention in
   machine translation and document classification, in this paper, we
   propose a Deep Hierarchical Attention Networks for Text Matching, namely
   Deep-HAN-Matching. Specifically, Deep-HAN-Matching extracts meaningful
   matching patterns and rich contextual features hierarchically from words
   to total document at the query term level using the recurrent neural
   network and attention mechanism, and finally rank the matching score
   produced by the fully connected neural network. Experimental results on
   WikiQA, a popular benchmark dataset for answer sentence selection in
   question answering, show that our model can significantly outperform
   traditional retrieval baseline models and some recent deep neural
   network based matching models.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to content-based recommendation and collaborative

   to cluster users into groups of similar interests based on theirs usage
   data and to determine a representative profile for each of the groups.
   When a new user joins the system, he or she is classified into one of
   existing group based on his or her user data and the representative
   profile of the group becomes a starting profile for the new user. This
   paper focuses on a method for updating ontology-based user profile using
   Bayesian network approach. We analyze some properties of proposed

   The comparative experiments prove that the respective addition of length

   precision ratio of the top ten improved by 43.6\%, 69.2\% and 35.9\%

   technolo to realize the fast indexing after Chinese word segmentation,
   and applies the mature TF-IDF algorithm to realize the text search.
   Based on the structural characteristics of the railway accident fault
   tracking report, a text feature extraction method based on text format
   and regular expression is adopted to realize the extraction of accident
   name, accident location and so on. Finally, this paper adopts a railway
   bureau's railway company accident tracking report to do experiments and

Title = {{Deep Multi-Modal Metric Learning with Multi-Scale Correlation for
   Image-Text Retrieval}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Multi-modal retrieval is a challenge due to heterogeneous gap and a
   complex semantic relationship between different modal data. Typical
   research map different modalities into a common subspace with a
   one-to-one correspondence or similarity/dissimilarity relationship of
   inter-modal data, in which the distances of heterogeneous data can be
   compared directly; thus, inter-modal retrieval can be achieved by the
   nearest neighboring search. However, most of them ignore intra-modal
   relations and complicated semantics between multi-modal data. In this
   paper, we propose a deep multi-modal metric learning method with
   multi-scale semantic correlation to deal with the retrieval tasks
   between image and text modalities. A deep model with two branches is
   designed to nonlinearly map raw heterogeneous data into comparable
   representations. In contrast to binary similarity, we formulate semantic
   relationship with multi-scale similarity to learn fine-grained
   multi-modal distances. Inter-modal and intra-modal correlations
   constructed on multi-scale semantic similarity are incorporated to train
   the deep model in an end-to-end way. Experiments validate the
   effectiveness of our proposed method on multi-modal retrieval tasks, and
   our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NUS-WIDE, MIR Flickr,
   and Wikipedia datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework for utilizing domain ontology and graph
   representation in ad-hoc document retrieval. The main task is to
   retrieve a ranked list of (text) documents from a fixed corpus in
   response to free-form keyword queries. In this work, the query and
   documents are modeled by enhanced graph based representations. Ranking
   features are generated by matching the two representations through
   semantic similarity measures which consider both semantic and
   statistical information in documents to improve search performance. The
   suitability of the solution has been demonstrated through applications
   of document retrieval such as The learning resource repository
   management system and The Vietnamese online news aggregating system and
   The job seeking system in the field of Information Technology. The
   results show that the incorporation of domain ontology with semantic
   graph structure improves the quality of the retrieval solution compared
   with documents modeled by bag of words or vector space model only.}},

Abstract = {{Web is considered as the largest information pool and search engine, a
   tool for extracting information from web, but due to unorganized
   structure of the web it is getting difficult to use search engine tool
   for finding relevant information from the web. Future search engine
   tools will not be based merely on keyword search, whereas they will be
   able to interpret the meaning of the web contents to produce relevant
   results. Design of such tools requires extracting information from the
   contents which supports logic and inferential capability. This paper
   discusses the conceptual differences between the traditional web and
   semantic web, specifying the need for crawling semantic web documents.
   In this paper a framework is proposed for crawling the
   ontologies/semantic web documents. The proposed framework is implemented
   and validated on different collection of web pages. This system has
   features of extracting heterogeneous documents from the web, filtering
   the ontology annotated web pages and extracting triples from them which
   supports better inferential capability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores advances in the data mining field to solve the
   fundamental Document Information Retrieval problem. In the proposed
   approach, useful knowledge is first discovered by using data mining
   techniques, then swarms use this knowledge to explore the whole space of
   documents intelligently. We have investigated two data mining techniques
   in the preprocessing step. The first one aims to split the collection of
   documents into similar clusters by using the k-means algorithm, while
   the second one extracts the most closed frequent terms on each cluster
   already created using the DCI\_Closed algorithm. For the solving step,
   BSO (Bees Swarm Optimization) is used to explore the cluster of
   documents deeply. The proposed approach has been evaluated on well-known
   collections such as CACM (Collection of ACM), TREC (Text REtrieval
   Conference), Webdocs, and Wikilinks, and it has been compared to
   state-of-the-art data mining, bio-inspired and other documents
   information retrieval based approaches. The results show that the
   proposed approach improves the quality of returned documents
   considerably, with a competitive computational time compared to
   state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OCR errors in text harm information retrieval performance. Much research
   has been reported on modelling and correction of Optical Character
   Recognition (OCR) errors. Most of the prior work employ language
   dependent resources or training texts in studying the nature of errors.
   However, not much research has been reported that focuses on improving
   retrieval performance from erroneous text in the absence of training
   data. We propose a novel approach for detecting OCR errors and improving
   retrieval performance from the erroneous corpus in a situation where
   training samples are not available to model errors. In this paper we
   propose a method that automatically identifies erroneous term variants
   in the noisy corpus, which are used for query expansion, in the absence
   of clean text. We employ an effective combination of contextual
   information and string matching techniques. Our proposed approach
   automatically identifies the erroneous variants of query terms and
   consequently leads to improvement in retrieval performance through query
   expansion. Our proposed approach does not use any training data or any
   language specific resources like thesaurus for identification of error
   variants. It also does not expend any knowledge about the language
   except that the word delimiter is blank space. We have tested our
   approach on erroneous Bangla (Bengali in English) and Hindi FIRE
   collections, and also on TREC Legal IIT CDIP and TREC 5 Confusion track
   English corpora. Our proposed approach has achieved statistically
   significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines- on most of
   the datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews and analyses the limitation of the existing method
   used in the IR process in retrieving Malay Translated Hadith documents
   related to the search request. Traditional Malay Translated Hadith
   retrieval system has not focused on semantic extraction from text. The
   bag-of-words representation ignores the conceptual similarity of
   information in the query text and documents, which produce
   unsatisfactory retrieval results. Therefore, a more efficient IR
   framework is needed. This paper claims that the significant information
   extraction and subject-related information are actually important
   because the clues from this information can be used to search and find
   the relevance document to a query. Also, unimportant information can be
   discarded to represent the document content. So, semantic understanding
   of query and document is necessary to improve the effectiveness and
   accuracy of retrieval results for this domain study. Therefore, advance
   research is needed and it will be experimented in the future work. It is
   hoped that it will help users to search and find information regarding
   to the Malay Translated Hadith document.}},

Title = {{A dummy-based user privacy protection approach for text information
   retrieval}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Text retrieval enables people to efficiently obtain the desired data
   from massive text data, so has become one of the most popular services
   in information retrieval community. However, while providing great
   convenience for users, text retrieval results in a serious issue on user
   privacy. In this paper, we propose a dummy-based approach for text
   retrieval privacy protection. Its basic idea is to use well-designed
   dummy queries to cover up user queries and thus protect user privacy.
   First, we present a client-based system framework for the protection of
   user privacy, which requires no change to the existing algorithm of text
   retrieval, and no compromise to the accuracy of text retrieval. Second,
   we define a user privacy model to formulate the requirements that ideal
   dummy queries should meet, i.e., (1) having highly similar feature
   distributions with user queries, and (2) effectively reducing the
   significance of user query topics. Third, by means of the knowledge
   derived from Wikipedia, we present an implementation algorithm to
   construct a group of ideal dummy queries that can well meet the privacy
   model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
   theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The results show that
   by constructing dummy queries that have similar feature distributions
   but unrelated topics with user queries, the privacy behind users'
   textual queries can be effectively protected, under the precondition of
   not compromising the accuracy and usability of text retrieval. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Significant amounts of information available today contain references to
   places on earth. Traditionally such information has been held as
   structured data and was the concern of Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS). However, increasing amounts of data in the form of unstructured
   text are available for indexing and retrieval that also contain spatial
   references. This monograph describes the field of Geographic Information
   Retrieval (GIR) that seeks to develop spatially-aware search systems and
   support user's geographical information needs. Important concepts with
   respect to storing, querying and analysing geographical information in
   computers are introduced, before user needs and interaction in the
   context of GIR are explored. The task of associating documents with
   coordinates, prior to their indexing and ranking forms the core of any
   GIR system, and different approaches and their implications are
   discussed. Evaluating the resulting systems and their components, and
   different paradigms for doing so continue to be an important area of
   research in GIR and are illustrated through a number of examples. The
   article concludes by setting out a range of future challenges for
   research in this field.}},

Abstract = {{In Information Retrieval systems, stemming handles the words that can
   occur in different morphological forms, and hence matches the terms of
   the documents and the queries that are related in meanings. In this
   article, we have proposed a cognitive inspired language-independent
   stemming that learns group of morphologically related words from the
   ambient corpus without any linguistic knowledge or human intervention
   and it behaves in a way the human brain works. The main idea of our
   proposed algorithm is to determine only those variants of the words from
   the ambient corpus that match the original intent of the query terms. We
   conducted ad-hoc retrieval experiments in a number of languages of
   varying morphological complexity using standard TREC, FIRE, and CLEF
   document collection. The results indicate that stemming improves the
   retrieval accuracy and the effectiveness of stemming algorithm increases
   with the increase in the morphological complexity of algorithm. The
   results also indicates that the performance of our proposed algorithm is
   better than the stemmers based on linguistic knowledge and other
   state-of-the-art statistical stemmers in almost all the languages under
   study. In multi-lingual setup these results are quite encouraging. (C)

Abstract = {{Cross-modal information retrieval aims to find heterogeneous data of
   various modalities from a given query of one modality. The main
   challenge is to map different modalities into a common semantic space,
   in which distance between concepts in different modalities can be well
   modeled. For cross-modal information retrieval between images and texts,
   existing work mostly uses off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN) for image feature extraction. For texts, word-level features such
   as bag-of-words or word2vec are employed to build deep learning models
   to represent texts. Besides word-level semantics, the semantic relations
   between words are also informative but less explored. In this paper, we
   model texts by graphs using similarity measure based on word2vec. A
   dual-path neural network model is proposed for couple feature learning
   in cross-modal information retrieval. One path utilizes Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) for text modeling based on graph
   representations. The other path uses a neural network with layers of
   nonlinearities for image modeling based on off-the-shelf features. The
   model is trained by a pairwise similarity loss function to maximize the
   similarity of relevant text-image pairs and minimize the similarity of
   irrelevant pairs. Experimental results show that the proposed model
   outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly, with 17\%
   improvement on accuracy for the best case.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel extended co-citation search technique, which
   is graph-based document retrieval on a co-citation network containing
   citation context information. The proposed search expands the scope of
   the target documents by repetitively spreading the relationship of
   co-citation in order to obtain relevant documents that are not
   identified by traditional co-citation searches. Specifically, this
   search technique is a combination of (a) applying a graph-based
   algorithm to compute the similarity score on a complicated network, and
   (b) incorporating co-citation contexts into the process of calculating
   similarity scores to reduce the negative effects of an increasing number
   of irrelevant documents. To evaluate the search performance of the
   proposed search, 10 proposed methods (five representative graph-based
   algorithms applied to co-citation networks weighted with/without
   contexts) are compared with two kinds of baselines (a traditional
   co-citation search with/without contexts) in information retrieval
   experiments based on two test collections (biomedicine and computer
   linguistic articles). The experiment results showed that the scores of
   the normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG@K) of the proposed
   methods using co-citation contexts tended to be higher than those of the
   baselines. In addition, the combination of the random walk with restart
   (RWR) algorithm and the network weighted with contexts achieved the best
   search performance among the 10 proposed methods. Thus, it is clarified
   that the combination of graph-based algorithms and co-citation contexts
   are effective in improving the performance of co-citation search
   techniques, and that sole use of a graph-based algorithm is not enough
   to enhance search performances from the baselines.}},

Abstract = {{As Cloud Computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive
   information has been outsourced into cloud. A straightforward
   methodology that can protect data privacy is to encrypt the data before
   outsourcing. Recently, many searchable encryption schemes have been
   proposed to allow users to execute keyword-based search over encrypted
   data. However, it is different for users to exactly find all the
   interested files from the huge amounts of data by relying solely on
   keyword-based search. In information retrieval domain, full-text
   retrieval is an efficient information retrieval technology that allows
   efficient searches over massive amount of web data. Unfortunately, when
   applied in the cloud paradigm, full-text retrieval over encrypted cloud
   data have not been well studied. The full-text retrieval service
   requires extracting all the words in the contents of documents. The huge
   scale of index words cannot be efficiently supported by the existing
   searchable encryption schemes. Moreover, to protect user's privacy, a
   privacy-preserved full-text retrieval index is required. These problems
   make efficient full-text retrieval over a large amount of encrypted
   cloud data a very challenging task. In this paper, we first establish a
   set of strict privacy requirements for full-text retrieval in cloud
   storage systems. To address the challenging problem, we design a Bloom
   filter based tree index. Our scheme fine-tunes the similarity between
   the query and encrypted documents by proposing the membership entropies
   of index words. Our scheme is provably secure through our security
   analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
   proposed scheme through extensive experimental evaluation. The
   experimental results manifest the search operation can be done in 60
   milliseconds using an off-the-shelf moderate PC. (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {{On the relationship between bug reports and queries for text
   retrieval-based bug localization}},

Abstract = {{As societal dependence on software continues to grow, bugs are becoming
   increasingly costly in terms of financial resources as well as human
   safety.Bug localizationis the process by which a developer identifies
   buggy code that needs to be fixed to make a system safer and more
   reliable. Unfortunately, manually attempting to locate bugs solely from
   the information in a bug report requires advanced knowledge of how a
   system is constructed and the way its constituent pieces interact.
   Therefore, previous work has investigated numerous techniques for
   reducing the human effort spent in bug localization. One of the most
   common approaches is Text Retrieval (TR) in which a system's source code
   is indexed into a search space that is then queried for code relevant to
   a given bug report. In the last decade, dozens of papers have proposed
   improvements to bug localization using TR with largely positive results.
   However, several other studies have called the technique into question.
   According to these studies, evaluations of TR-based approaches often
   lack sufficient controls on biases that artificially inflate the
   results, namely: misclassified bugs, tangled commits, and localization
   hints. Here we argue that contemporary evaluations of TR approaches also
   include a negative bias that outweighs the previously identified
   positive biases: while TR approaches expect a natural language query,
   most evaluations simply formulate this query as the full text of a bug
   report. In this study we show that highly performing queries can be
   extracted from the bug report text, in order to make TR effective even
   without the aforementioned positive biases. Further, we analyze the
   provenance of terms in these highly performing queries to drive future
   work in automatic query extraction from bug reports.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{1037-1046}},
Abstract = {{It is getting more difficult to retrieve relevant information regarding
   the user input query due to the large amount of information in the web.
   Unlike the conventional information retrieval (IR) algorithms, this
   study presents a new algorithm - reduced row echelon form IR method
   (rrefIR) - with higher average similarity precision to get more relevant
   and noise-free documents. For dimension reduction in the proposed
   algorithm, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied on the reduced
   row echelon form - obtained by utilizing Gauss-Jordan method - of the
   covariance of term-document matrix (TDM). The rrefIR algorithm
   outperforms the LSI and COV algorithms with respect to Jaro-Winkler,
   Overlap, Tanimoto and Jaccard similarity measures in the means of
   average similarity precision. The physical reason for the better IR
   performance is the linear independent basis vectors set obtained by
   Gauss-Jordan operation. This basis set can be considered as the
   generating roots of the vector space spanned by TDM. Utilizing these
   vectors increases the latent semantic charateristics of the SVD phase of
   the proposed IR algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Current research usually adopts the standard process of Vector Space
   Model (VSM) in searching and retrieving information on Malay documents.
   However, this technique is less effective for semantic information
   retrieval from the collection. The system will only retrieve documents
   which contain the user's query terms and ignore semantic information
   among those terms. Therefore, several documents that have similar
   context are ignored and several document context that share a single
   term are retrieved. Due to this problem, Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   (LDA) model is applied for semantic information retrieval on Malay
   documents. An experiment was illustrated based on 6 queries text and 50
   Hadith documents translated in Malay language, composed of Shahih
   Bukhari collections. Experimental results proved that the LDA model
   gives promising results in retrieving semantic information in Malay
   translated Hadith documents compare to existing techniques. Some
   limitation from this study can be explored for future work in order to
   improve the effectiveness of the retrieval results. Overall, LDA is an
   effective method for semantic information retrieval on Malay document,
   thus, it can help people to easily search and retrieve semantic
   information from Malay documents.}},

Abstract = {{Credit risk evaluation and sales target optimization are core businesses
   for financial institutions. Financial documents like t-balances, balance
   sheets, income statements are the most important inputs for both of
   these core businesses. T-balance is a semi-structured financial document
   which is constructed periodically by accountants and contains detailed
   accounting transactions. FOCA is an end to end system which first
   classifies financial documents in order to recognize t-balances, then
   digitalizes them into a tree-structured form and finally extracts
   valuable information such as bank names, human-company distinction,
   deposit type and liability term from free format text fields of
   t-balances. The information extracted is also enriched by matching human
   and company names who are in a relationship with existing customers of
   the bank from the customer database. Pattern recognition, natural
   language processing, and information retrieval techniques are utilized
   for these capabilities. FOCA supports both decision/operational
   processes of corporate/commercial/SME sales and financial analysis
   departments in order to empower new customer engagement, cross-sell and
   up-sell to the existing customers and ease financial analysis operations
   by digitalizing t-balances.}},

   selectivity of search tools and improve the way in which these tools are
   evaluated. These proposals have been tested, and the gain in terms of
   returned results relevance was measured using three search engines

Abstract = {{Neural embeddings are widely used in language modeling and feature
   generation with superior computational power. Particularly, neural
   document embedding - converting texts of variable-length to semantic
   vector representations - has shown to benefit widespread downstream
   applications, e.g., information retrieval (IR). However, the black-box
   nature makes it difficult to understand how the semantics are encoded
   and employed. We propose visual exploration of neural document embedding
   to gain insights into the underlying embedding space, and promote the
   utilization in prevalent IR applications. In this study, we take an IR
   application-driven view, which is further motivated by biomedical IR in
   healthcare decision-making, and collaborate with domain experts to
   design and develop a visual analytics system. This system visualizes
   neural document embeddings as a configurable document map and enables
   guidance and reasoning; facilitates to explore the neural embedding
   space and identify salient neural dimensions (semantic features) per
   task and domain interest; and supports advisable feature selection
   (semantic analysis) along with instant visual feedback to promote IR
   performance. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this
   system and present inspiring findings in use cases. This work will help
   designers/developers of downstream applications gain insights and

Abstract = {{The application of information retrieval techniques to search tasks in
   software engineering is made difficult by the lexical gap between search
   queries, usually expressed in natural language (e.g. English), and
   retrieved documents, usually expressed in code (e.g. programming
   languages). This is often the case in bug and feature location,
   community question answering, or more generally the communication
   between technical personnel and non-technical stake holders in a
   software project. In this paper, we propose bridging the lexical gap by
   projecting natural language statements and code snippets as meaning
   vectors in a shared representation space. In the proposed architecture,
   word embeddings are first trained on API documents, tutorials, and
   reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic
   similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the
   learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously
   explored bug localization task and a newly defined task of linking API
   documents to computer programming questions.}},

   analyse two important but distinct reasons for normalising documents
   with respect to length, namely verbosity and scope, and discuss the
   practical implications of not normalising accordingly. We review a
   number of language modelling approaches and a range of recently
   developed retrieval methods, and show that most do not correctly model
   both phenomena, thus limiting their retrieval effectiveness in certain
   situations. Furthermore, the retrieval characteristics of long natural
   language queries have not traditionally had the same attention as short
   keyword queries. We develop a new discriminative query language
   modelling approach that demonstrates improved performance on long
   verbose queries by appropriately weighting salient aspects of the query.
   When combined with query expansion, we show that our new approach yields
   state-of-the-art performance for long verbose queries.}},

Pages = {{587+}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Digital technologies can help scholars to navigate the vast quantities
   of musical data and source materials now available to them, but an
   imaginative leap is needed in order to conceptualize the kinds of
   musicological research questions we might ask of electronic corpora. In
   particular, our data-rich digital world offers enormous potential for
   the exploration of musical transmission and relatedness.
   In this article, we explore the 16th- and 17th-century instrumental
   battaglia (battle piece), a genre with a very distinctive collective
   identity arising from the use of numerous shared ingredients (including
   melodic, motivic, textural, harmonic and rhythmic features). However, a
   battaglia is not defined by the presence of a core set of essential
   features, and exact concordance between these pieces is often remarkably
   low. This kind of musical `family resemblance' (formulated after
   Wittgenstein) poses a serious challenge to both traditional
   musicological apparatus (for example, finding aids such as thematic
   catalogues) and Music Information Retrieval (which has often privileged
   melodic similarity at the expense of other kinds of musical
   relatedness).
   This case study provides a stimulus for rethinking the complex nature of
   musical similarity. In doing this, we outline a set of requirements for
   digital tools that could support the discovery, exploration and
   representation of these kinds of relationships.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of big data, volume of online text documents has exploded
   through social media, search engines, and many other channels. Rapid
   growth of data demands more efficient processing and information
   retrieval approaches, among those Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and
   Word2Vec are commonly used. LDA explains a global relationship by
   investigating latent topics from a collection of documents and assigning
   each document with a probability distribution over all topics. In
   contrary, Word2Vec projects words to vectors with semantic meanings by
   local contexts. However, LDA concentrates on handling high probability
   words and neglects low probability but meaningful ones. While Word2Vec
   explores only surroundings of the target words within sentences, which
   makes global improvement of word representations very difficult.
   Therefore, we propose an improved text information retrieval method that
   integrates both global and local text information. Experimental results
   show that our proposed document representation method significantly
   enhance accuracy of classification analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Vector space model (VSM) is an Information Retrieval (IR) system model
   that represents query and documents as n-dimension vector. GVSM is an
   expansion from VSM that represents the documents base on similarity
   value between query and minterm vector space of documents collection.
   Minterm vector is defined by the term in query. Therefore, in retrieving
   a document can be done base on word meaning inside the query. On the
   contrary, a document can consist the same information semantically. LSI
   is a method implemented in IR system to retrieve document base on
   overall meaning of users' query input from a document, not based on each
   word translation. LSI uses a matrix algebra technique namely Singular
   Value Decomposition (SVD). This study discusses the performance of VSM,
   GVSM and LSI that are implemented on IR to retrieve Indonesian sentences
   document of. pdf,. doc and. docx extension type files, by using Nazief
   and Adriani stemming algorithm. Each method implemented either by thread
   or no-thread. Thread is implemented in preprocessing process in reading
   each document from document collection and stemming process either for
   query or documents. The quality of information retrieval performance is
   evaluated based-on time response, values of recall, precision, and
   F-measure were measured. The results show that for each method, the
   fastest execution time is. docx extension type file followed by. doc
   and. pdf. For the same document collection, the results show that time
   response for LSI is more faster, followed by GVSM then VSM. The average
   of recall value for VSM, GVSM and LSI are 82.86 \%, 89.68 \% and 84.93
   \% respectively. The average of precision value for VSM, GVSM and LSI
   are 64.08 \%, 67.51 \% and 62.08 \% respectively. The average of
   F-measure value for VSM, GVSM and LSI are 71.95 \%, 76.63 \% and 71.02
   \% respectively. Implementation of multithread for preprocessing for
   VSM, GVSM, and LSI can increase average time response required is about
   30.422\%, 26.282\%, and 31.821\% respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the rapid growth of multimodal data from the internet and
   social media, a cross-modal retrieval has become an important and
   valuable task in recent years.The purpose of the cross-modal retrieval
   is to obtain the result data in one modality (e.g., image), which is
   semantically similar to the query data in another modality (e.g.,
   text).In the field of remote sensing, despite a great number of existing
   works on image retrieval, there has only been a small amount of research
   on the cross-modal image-text retrieval, due to the scarcity of datasets
   and the complicated characteristics of remote sensing image data. In
   this article, we introduce a novel cross-modal image-text retrieval
   network to establish the direct relationship between remote sensing
   images and their paired text data. Specifically, in our framework, we
   designed a semantic alignment module to fully explore the latent
   correspondence between images and text, in which we used the attention
   and gate mechanisms to filter and optimize data features so that more
   discriminative feature representations can be obtained. Experimental
   results on four benchmark remote sensing datasets, including
   UCMerced-LandUse-Captions, Sydney-Captions, RSICD, and
   NWPU-RESISC45-Captions, well showed that our proposed method
   outperformed other baselines and achieved the state-of-the-art
   performance in remote sensing image-text retrieval tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Historical accounts (ca 17th-19th centuries ce) are valuable for
   understanding how and where past Native American cultures used fire as a
   land management tool. Previous research has compiled and interpreted
   accounts, but methods of compiling them remains less systematic, leaving
   open the possibility that undiscovered accounts exist. This study uses
   information retrieval methods to locate accounts of Native American
   burning within digitized historical documents. Utilizing known accounts
   from digitized documents, this research develops a model to rank text
   portions within unread documents based on their predicted relevance. The
   model used frequencies of key terms and related textual features as
   predictors, and the presence and absence of accounts within text
   portions as the dependent variable. Within 121 documents related to
   western New York State (NYS), USA, this study discovered 40 accounts
   including 28 in western NYS. Of accounts in western NYS, 12 accounts
   (describing 21 locations) made explicit connections to Native American
   burning, were resolvable to town-level or finer resolution, and were not
   derivative of other texts. To locate all known accounts, the model aided
   in reducing the amount of text to read to only 0.61\% of total.
   Locations of burning were 0.0 to 16.2 km (median = 5.6 km) from the
   nearest Native American village area, and 0.1 to 12.5 km (median = 1.5
   km) from the nearest trail. This study demonstrates how information
   retrieval can discover accounts of Native American burning, and suggests
   that undiscovered historical accounts exist that may advance historical,
   cultural, and ecological understandings of burning practices.}},

Abstract = {{Information Retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information
   resources relevant to a questioned information. It usually retrieves a
   set of objects ranked according to the relevancy to the needed fact. In
   document analysis, information retrieval receives a lot of attention in
   terms of symbol and word spotting. However, through decades the
   community mostly focused either on printed or on single writer scenario,
   where the state-of-the-art results have achieved reasonable performance
   on the available datasets. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms do not
   perform accordingly on multiwriter scenario. A graph representing
   relations between a set of objects is a structure where each node
   delineates an individual element and the similarity between them is
   represented as a weight on the connecting edge. In this paper, we
   explore different analytics of graphs constructed from words or
   graphical symbols, such as diffusion, shortest path, etc. to improve the
   performance of information retrieval methods in multiwriter scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing daily of users documentation in the global
   communications network, the management, and control of its information
   in it have been challenged. How to extract useful knowledge in an
   Internet heterogeneous environment is essential. Information retrieval
   techniques can retrieve user information needs in a large amount of
   data. Search engines are the first selection of users to find
   information. In this search, Web crawler plays a key role in search
   engines. A web crawler is a script that routinely scans the web. In this
   paper, a information retrieval method will be presented using a
   combination of vector space modeling and language statistical model to
   improve the retrieve of related documents. The proposed approach is
   based on the structural similarity of the document corpus. Measuring the
   similarity of the input term is based on the shortest path between each
   term and the next term. In this method, the number of nodes, edges and
   links is calculated. Finally, the similarity using the path feature and
   cosine similarity is measured.Available documents the proposed method by
   the crawler of the web is compiled from various Wikipedia pages. The
   results of the conceptual retrieved of documents show that 84\%
   accuracy, 88\% recall and average precision of 56\% have improved
   compared to other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating Information Retrieval systems is crucial to making progress
   in search technologies. Evaluation is often based on assembling
   reference collections consisting of documents, queries and relevance
   judgments done by humans. In large-scale environments, exhaustively
   judging relevance becomes infeasible. Instead, only a pool of documents
   is judged for relevance. By selectively choosing documents from the pool
   we can optimize the number of judgments required to identify a given
   number of relevant documents. We argue that this iterative selection
   process can be naturally modeled as a reinforcement learning problem and
   propose innovative and formal adjudication methods based on multi-armed
   bandits. Casting document judging as a multi-armed bandit problem is not
   only theoretically appealing, but also leads to highly effective
   adjudication methods. Under this bandit allocation framework, we
   consider stationary and non-stationary models and propose seven new
   document adjudication methods (five stationary methods and two
   non-stationary variants). Our paper also reports a series of experiments
   performed to thoroughly compare our new methods against current
   adjudication methods. This comparative study includes existing methods
   designed for pooling-based evaluation and existing methods designed for
   metasearch. Our experiments show that our theoretically grounded
   adjudication methods can substantially minimize the assessment effort.

   We study how to exploit the relationships between genes, variants,

   refinement. For a supervised approach, we are faced with a small amount
   of annotated data and a large amount of unannotated data. Therefore, we
   explore ways to use a neural document auto-encoder in a semi-supervised

Abstract = {{With the advent of the big-data era, massive information stored in
   electronic and digital forms on the internet become valuable resources
   for knowledge discovery in engineering design. Traditional document
   retrieval method based on document indexing focuses on retrieving
   individual documents related to the query, but is incapable of
   discovering the various associations between individual knowledge
   concepts. Ontology-based technologies, which can extract the inherent
   relationships between concepts by using advanced text mining tools, can
   be applied to improve design information retrieval in the large-scale
   unstructured textual data environment. However, few of the public
   available ontology database stands on a design and engineering
   perspective to establish the relations between knowledge concepts. This
   paper develops a ``WordNet{''} focusing on design and engineering
   associations by integrating the text mining approaches to construct an
   unsupervised learning ontology network. Subsequent probability and
   velocity network analysis are applied with different statistical
   behaviors to evaluate the correlation degree between concepts for design
   information retrieval. The validation results show that the probability
   and velocity analysis on our constructed ontology network can help
   recognize the high related complex design and engineering associations
   between elements. Finally, an engineering design case study demonstrates
   the use of our constructed semantic network in real-world project for
   design relations retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Spoken document retrieval for a specific context is a very trending and
   interesting area of research. It makes it convenient for users to search
   through archives of speech data, which is not possible manually as it is
   very time consuming and expensive. In the current article, we focus on
   performing the same for political speeches, delivered in a variety of
   environments. The technique used here takes an archive of spoken
   documents (audio files) as input and performs automatic speech
   recognition (ASR) on it to derive the textual transcripts, using deep
   neural networks (DNN), hidden markov models (HMM) and Gaussian mixture
   models (GMM). These transcriptions are further pruned for indexing by
   applying certain pre-processing techniques. Thereafter, it builds time
   and space efficient index of the documents using wavelet trees for its
   retrieval. The constructed index is searched through to find the count
   of occurrences of the words in the query, fired by the users. These
   counts are then utilized to calculate the term frequency - inverse
   document frequency (TF-IDF) scores, and then the similarity score of the
   query with each document is calculated using cosine similarity method.
   Finally, the documents are ranked based on these scores in the order of
   relevance. Therefore, the proposed system develops a speech recognition
   system and introduces a novel indexing scheme, based on wavelet trees
   for retrieving data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to have more
   accurate results in comparing performance of the paired information
   retrieval (IR) systems with reference to the current method, which is
   based on the mean effectiveness scores of the systems across a set of
   identified topics/queries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the proposed approach, instead of
   the classic method of using a set of topic scores, the documents level
   scores are considered as the evaluation unit. These document scores are
   the defined document's weight, which play the role of the mean average
   precision (MAP) score of the systems as a significance test's statics.
   The experiments were conducted using the TREC 9 Web track collection.
   Findings - The p-values generated through the two types of significance
   tests, namely the Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney show that by using
   the document level scores as an evaluation unit, the difference between
   IR systems is more significant compared with utilizing topic scores.
   Originality/value - Utilizing a suitable test collection is a primary
   prerequisite for IR systems comparative evaluation. However, in addition
   to reusable test collections, having an accurate statistical testing is
   a necessity for these evaluations. The findings of this study will
   assist IR researchers to evaluate their retrieval systems and algorithms
   more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at the automatic selection of the relevant documents for
   the blind relevance feedback method in speech information retrieval.
   Usually the relevant documents are selected only by simply determining
   the first N documents to be relevant. On the contrary, the previous
   first experiments with the automatic selection of the relevant documents
   for the blind relevance feedback method has shown the possibilities of
   the dynamical selection of the relevant documents for each query
   depending on the content of the retrieved documents instead of just
   blindly defining the number of the relevant documents to be used in
   advance. In the first experiments, the World Model Normalization method
   was used. Based on the promising results, the experiments presented in
   this paper try to thoroughly examine the possibilities of the
   application of different score normalization techniques used in the
   speaker identification task, which was successfully used in the related
   task of multi-label classification for finding the ``correct{''} topics
   of a newspaper article in the output of a generative classifier.}},

Abstract = {{Ontology mapping is a crucial task for the facilitation of information
   exchange and data integration. A mapping system can use a variety of
   similarity measures to determine concept correspondences. This paper
   proposes the integration of word-sense disambiguation techniques into
   lexical similarity measures. We propose a disambiguation methodology
   which entails the creation of virtual documents from concept and sense
   definitions, including their neighbourhoods. The specific terms are
   weighted according to their origin within their respective ontology. The
   document similarities between the concept document and sense documents
   are used to disambiguate the concept meanings. First, we evaluate to
   what extent the proposed disambiguation method can improve the
   performance of a lexical similarity metric. We observe that the
   disambiguation method improves the performance of each tested lexical
   similarity metric. Next, we demonstrate the potential of a mapping
   system utilizing the proposed approach through the comparison with
   contemporary ontology mapping systems. We observe a high performance on
   a real-world data set. Finally, we evaluate how the application of
   several term-weighting techniques on the virtual documents can affect
   the quality of the generated alignments. Here, we observe that weighting
   terms according to their ontology origin leads to the highest
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A new combination of multiple Information Retrieval approaches are
   proposed for book recommendation based on complex users' queries. We
   used different theoretical retrieval models: probabilistic as InL2
   (Divergence From Randomness model) and language models and tested their
   interpolated combination. We considered the application of a graph based
   algorithm in a new retrieval approach to related document network
   comprised of social links. We called Directed Graph of Documents (DGD) a
   network constructed with documents and social information provided from
   each one of them. Specifically, this work tackles the problem of book
   recommendation in the context of CLEF Labs precisely Social Book Search
   track. We established a specific strategy for queries searching after
   separating query set into two genres ``Analogue{''} and ``Analogue{''}
   after analyzing users' needs. Series of reranking experiments
   demonstrate that combining retrieval models and exploiting linked
   documents for retrieving yield significant improvements in terms of
   standard ranked retrieval metrics. These results extend the
   applicability of link analysis algorithms to different environments.}},

Abstract = {{Information retrieval (IR) methods seek to locate meaningful documents
   in large collections of textual and other data. Few studies apply these
   techniques to discover descriptions in historical documents for physical
   geography applications. This absence is noteworthy given the use of
   qualitative historical descriptions in physical geography and the amount
   of historical documentation online. This study, therefore, introduces an
   IR approach for finding meaningful and geographically resolved
   historical descriptions in large digital collections of historical
   documents. Presenting a biogeography application, it develops a `search
   engine' using a boosted regression trees (BRT) model to assist in
   finding forest compositional descriptions (FCDs) based on textual
   features in a collection of county histories. The study then
   investigates whether FCDs corroborate existing estimates of relative
   abundances and spatial distributions of tree taxa from presettlement
   land survey records (PLSRs) and existing range maps. The BRT model is
   trained using portions of text from 458 US county histories. Evaluating
   the model's performance upon a spatially independent test dataset, the
   model helps discover 97.5\% of FCDs while reducing the amount of text to
   search through to 0.3\% of total. The prevalence rank of taxa in FCDs
   (i.e. the number of times a taxon is mentioned at least once in an FCD,
   divided by the total number of FCDs, then ranked) is strongly related to
   the abundance rank in PLSRs. Patterns in species mentions from FCDs
   generally match relative abundance patterns from PLSRs. However,
   analyses suggest that FCDs contain biases towards large and economically
   valuable tree taxa and against smaller taxa. In the end, the study
   demonstrates the potential of IR approaches for developing novel
   datasets over large geographic areas, corroborating existing historical
   datasets, and providing spatial coverage of historic phenomena.}},

Journal = {{WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY}},
Abstract = {{Text-based question answering (QA) is a challenging task which aims at
   finding short concrete answers for users' questions. This line of
   research has been widely studied with information retrieval (IR)
   techniques and has received increasing attention in recent years by
   considering deep neural network approaches. Deep learning (DL)
   approaches, which are the main focus of this paper, provide a powerful
   technique to learn multiple layers of representations and interaction
   between the questions and the answer sentences. In this paper, we
   provide a comprehensive overview of different models proposed for the QA
   task, including both a traditional IR perspective and a more recent deep
   neural network environment. We also introduce well-known datasets for
   the task and present available results from the literature to have a
   comparison between different techniques.

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the possibilities of adapting various ADR
   algorithms to the Russian language environment. In general, the ADR
   detection process consists of 4 steps: (1) data collection from social
   media; (2) classification/filtering of ADR assertive text segments; (3)
   extraction of ADR mentions from text segments; (4) analysis of extracted
   ADR mentions for signal generation. The implementation of each step in
   the Russian-language environment is associated with a number of
   difficulties in comparison with the traditional English-speaking
   environment. First of all, they are connected with the lack of necessary
   databases and specialized language resources. In addition, an important
   negative role is played by the complex grammatical structure of the
   Russian language. The authors present various methods of machine
   learning algorithms adaptation in order to overcome these difficulties.
   For step 3 on the material of Russian-language text forums using the
   ensemble classifier, the Accuracy = 0.805 was obtained. For step 4 on
   the material of Russian-language EHR, by adapting pyConTextNLP, the
   F-measure = 0.935 was obtained, and by adapting ConText algorithm, the
   F-measure = 0.92-0.95 was obtained. A method for full-scale performing
   of step 4 was developed using cue-based and rule-based approaches, and
   the F-measure = 67.5\% was obtained that is quite comparable to
   baseline.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method of data retrieval from free text
   documents in medical domain. Proposed approach creates the document
   summary and highlights most important keywords in the text. To achieve
   this result we process the document natural language text and build a
   descriptor as an internal representation of the document. This
   descriptor is a graph with concepts, relations between them, and concept
   points as a metric of relevance. By means of points in the descriptor
   the approach performs ambiguity resolution, selects most relevant
   concepts to display in the summary, and votes for keywords highlighting
   in the text. Besides the direct representation of identified information
   in the summary, this work proposes a way to provide extended summary by
   using additional knowledge about relations between medications,
   procedures, diseases and anatomy. The described approach helps to speed
   up analysis and decision making processes by means of providing
   aggregated summary for a document and highlighting most meaningful parts
   of the document's text. Experiment results demonstrate that automatic
   summary generation and keywords highlighting can be successfully
   performed by the proposed approach to achieve meaningful and highly
   relevant results.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMAGING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Visual-semantic embedding (VSE) networks create joint image-text
   representations to map images and texts in a shared embedding space to
   enable various information retrieval-related tasks, such as image-text
   retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering. The most
   recent state-of-the-art VSE-based networks are: VSE++, SCAN, VSRN, and
   UNITER. This study evaluates the performance of those VSE networks for
   the task of image-to-text retrieval and identifies and analyses their
   strengths and limitations to guide future research on the topic. The
   experimental results on Flickr30K revealed that the pre-trained network,
   UNITER, achieved 61.5\% on average Recall@5 for the task of retrieving
   all relevant descriptions. The traditional networks, VSRN, SCAN, and
   VSE++, achieved 50.3\%, 47.1\%, and 29.4\% on average Recall@5,
   respectively, for the same task. An additional analysis was performed on
   image-text pairs from the top 25 worst-performing classes using a subset
   of the Flickr30K-based dataset to identify the limitations of the
   performance of the best-performing models, VSRN and UNITER. These
   limitations are discussed from the perspective of image scenes, image
   objects, image semantics, and basic functions of neural networks. This
   paper discusses the strengths and limitations of VSE networks to guide
   further research into the topic of using VSE networks for cross-modal

Title = {{A new similarity measure for vector space models in text classification
   and information retrieval}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{There are various models, methodologies and algorithms that can be used
   today for document classification, information retrieval and other text
   mining applications and systems. One of them is the vector space-based
   models, where distance metrics or similarity measures lie at the core of
   such models. Vector space-based model is one of the fast and simple
   alternatives for the processing of textual data; however, its accuracy,
   precision and reliability still need significant improvements. In this
   study, a new similarity measure is proposed, which can be effectively
   used for vector space models and related algorithms such as k-nearest
   neighbours (k-NN) and Rocchio as well as some clustering algorithms such
   as K-means. The proposed similarity measure is tested with some
   universal benchmark data sets in Turkish and English, and the results
   are compared with some other standard metrics such as Euclidean
   distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev distance, Canberra distance,
   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, Pearson correlation coefficient and Cosine
   similarity. Some successful and promising results have been obtained,
   which show that this proposed similarity measure could be alternatively
   used within all suitable algorithms and models for information
   retrieval, document clustering and text classification.}},

Title = {{Ensembling of text and images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
   for Intelligent Information Retrieval}},
Journal = {{WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Information retrieval (IR) defines the process of searching and
   attaining specific information resources which are related to the
   specific information requirements from the available resource pool. It
   finds useful in several real time application areas namely digital
   library, healthcare, education, internet browsing, etc. Recently, deep
   learning (DL) models become popular in different fields of image
   processing, object detection, and natural language processing.
   Therefore, in this paper, DL models are employed to retrieve the text
   and images proficiently. This paper presents an ensemble of DL based IR
   models for text and images. The proposed model intends to develop DL
   models individually for text and images. Initially, convolutional neural
   network based VGGNet-19 model is used as a feature extractor and
   Euclidian distance based similarity measurement for the retrieval of
   images. At the same time, bidirectional-long short-term memory (BiLSTM)
   technique is applied for retrieval of textual documents. The presented
   BiLSTM model sequentially considers every word in a sentence, extracts
   the details and embeds it to the semantic vector. In addition to the
   feature extraction using deep learning techniques, the similarity
   measurement emphasis the closeness of the document to the given query.
   The proposed retrieval system has tested on text and images for both
   general and specific domain (agriculture) with the datasets of Yahoo,
   Google and Corel10K. With the datasets the performance has been computed
   by the standard measures such as precision, recall and F-score where the
   proposed deep learning model produces better results when compared to
   existing techniques. The proposed model has been tested for the specific
   domain and achieves the performance of 93\% precision and 85\% recall
   and 90\% F-score when compared to the existing model.}},

Title = {{Can Music Foster Learning - Effects of Different Text Modalities on
   Learning and Information Retrieval}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the possibilities of fostering learning based on
   differences in recall and comprehension after learning with texts which
   were presented in one of three modalities: either in a spoken, written,
   or sung version. All three texts differ regarding their processing,
   especially when considering working memory. Overall, we assume the best
   recall performance after learning with the written text and the best
   comprehension performance after learning with the sung text,
   respectively, compared to both other text modalities. We also analyzed
   whether the melody of the sung material functions as a mnemonic aid for
   the learners in the sung text condition. If melody and text of the sung
   version are closely linked, presentation of the melody during the
   post-test phase could foster text retrieval. 108 students either learned
   from a sung text performed by a professional singer, a printed text, or
   the same text read out loud. Half of the participants worked on the
   post-test while listening to the melody used for the musical learning
   material and the other half did not listen to a melody. The written
   learning modality led to significantly better recall than with the
   spoken (d = 0.97) or sung text (d = 0.78). However, comprehension after
   learning with the sung modality was significantly superior compared to
   when learning with the written learning modality (d = 0.40). Reading
   leads to more focus on details, which is required to answer recall
   questions, while listening fosters a general understanding of the text,
   leading to higher levels of comprehension. Listening to the melody
   during the post-test phase negatively affected comprehension,
   irrespective of the modality during the learning phase. This can be
   explained by the seductive detail effect, as listening to the melody
   during the post-test phase may distract learners from their main task.
   In closing, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art solutions to the vocabulary mismatch in information
   retrieval (IR) mainly aim at leveraging either the relational semantics
   provided by external resources or the distributional semantics, recently
   investigated by deep neural approaches. Guided by the intuition that the
   relational semantics might improve the effectiveness of deep neural
   approaches, we propose the Deep Semantic Resource Inference Model
   (DSRIM) that relies on: 1) a representation of raw-data that models the
   relational semantics of text by jointly considering objects and
   relations expressed in a knowledge resource, and 2) an end-to-end neural
   architecture that learns the query-document relevance by leveraging the
   distributional and relational semantics of documents and queries. The
   experimental evaluation carried out on two TREC datasets from TREC
   Terabyte and TREC CDS tracks relying respectively on WordNet and MeSH
   resources, indicates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{In the field of disaster prevention, it is crucial to provide the
   general public with appropriate integrated information before, during,
   and after the disasters. However, in such situations, individuals are
   not capable of establishing clear opinions owing to inconsistent and
   diverse information from multiple sources. As individuals receive varied
   inconsistent information from several sources, they are puzzled about
   the credibility of such information. This situation is defined as a
   belief drift in our study, and it must be alleviated by providing
   appropriate information. To create a system that provides the required
   information to individuals with drifting beliefs, we acquired reliable
   information from medical doctors and implemented the knowledge base and
   retrieval system to bridge the gap between professionals and
   nonprofessionals. We focused on certain blood diseases, collected large
   texts, and extracted the terms representing contexts and variables, and
   the medical doctors evaluated the relationships among these diseases. In
   this study, we discussed the design and the implementation of the
   proposed system and demonstrated its performance. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Topic modeling is an effective text mining and information retrieval
   approach to organizing knowledge with various contents under a specific
   topic. Text documents in form of news articles are increasing very fast
   on the web. Analysis of these documents is very important in the fields
   of text mining and information retrieval. Meaningful information
   extraction from these documents is a challenging task. One approach for
   discovering the theme from text documents is topic modeling but this
   approach still needs a new perspective to improve its performance. In
   topic modeling, documents have topics and topics are the collection of
   words. In this paper, we propose a new k-means topic modeling (KTM)
   approach by using the k-means clustering algorithm. KTM discovers better
   semantic topics from a collection of documents. Experiments on two
   real-world Reuters 21578 and BBC News datasets show that KTM performance
   is better than state-of-the-art topic models like LDA (Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation) and LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis). The KTM is also
   applicable for classification and clustering tasks in text mining and
   achieves higher performance with a comparison of its competitors LDA and
   LSA.}},

Abstract = {{Text resource selection is a primary concern for efficient and wide
   coverage document processing for the extraction of required bio-medical
   information, while size control and topic relevance are key issues to
   ensure high-quality output from the retrieval system. In this study, we
   analysed terms and terminologies used for adverse reaction and side
   effect of drugs. Furthermore, we proposed an effective strategy that
   used an intersection of unions of both `adverse react' hyponyms and
   `side effect' hyponyms to evaluate their semantic relationships,
   including the similarities and differences, in massive biomedical texts.
   Our results showed that the hyponyms related to these two superordinates
   perform differently in their use as signifiers of relevant documents.
   Our proposed strategy resulted in an optimal trade-off for relevant
   abstract retrieval, followed with empirical work of drug/gene matching
   in order to test the proposed strategy. The results also confirmed that
   the strategy was capable of maintaining a good trade-off between text
   size and content relevance.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for enhanced context-based document relevance assessment
   and ranking to facilitate the retrieval of more relevant information for
   supporting environmental decision making. This paper proposes a new
   context-based relevance assessment method, which allows'for enhanced
   context representation and context-based document relevance recognition
   through: (1) a context-aware and deep semantic concept indexing
   approach, and (2) a deep and semantically-sensitive relevance estimation
   approach. The proposed relevance assessment method was integrated into
   two widely-used document ranking models {[}vector space model (VSM) and
   statistical language model (SLM)], resulting in two improved ranking
   methods: (1) a context-enhanced VSM-based method, and (2) a
   context-enhanced SLM-based method. The two context-enhanced document
   ranking methods were evaluated in retrieving webpages that are relevant
   to transportation project environmental review. The two context-enhanced
   methods were compared with each other and with their provenance methods
   (i.e., original VSM and SLM) in terms of mean precision (MP) and mean
   average precision (MAP). The context-enhanced VSM-based method
   outperformed the context-enhanced SLM-based method on every metric. It
   achieved 48\% MAP, 79\% MP at the top 10 retrieved documents, and over
   65\% MP at the top 50 retrieved documents, on the testing data. It also
   showed significant improvement over the state-of-the-art keyword-based
   VSM method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Last Few Relevant Documents for Technology-assisted Reviews}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{While continuous active learning algorithms have proven effective in
   finding most of the relevant documents in a collection, the cost for
   locating the last few remains high for applications such as
   Technology-assisted Reviews (TAR). To locate these last few but
   significant documents efficiently, Zou et al. {[}2018] have proposed a
   novel interactive algorithm. The algorithm is based on constructing
   questions about the presence or absence of entities in the missing
   relevant documents. The hypothesis made is that entities play a central
   role in documents carrying key information and that the users are able
   to answer questions about the presence or absence of an entity in the
   missing relevance documents. Based on this, a Sequential Bayesian
   Search-based approach that selects the optimal sequence of questions to
   ask was devised. In this work, we extend Zou et al. {[}2018] by (a)
   investigating the noise tolerance of the proposed algorithm; (b)
   proposing an alternative objective function to optimize, which accounts
   for user ``erroneous{''} answers; (c) proposing a method that
   sequentially decides the best point to stop asking questions to the
   user; and (d) conducting a small user study to validate some of the
   assumptions made by Zou et al. {[}2018]. Furthermore, all experiments
   are extended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
   not only in the phase of abstract appraisal (i.e., finding the abstracts
   of potentially relevant documents in a collection) but also finding the
   documents to be included in the review (i.e., finding the subset of
   those relevant abstracts for which the article remains relevant). The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can
   greatly improve performance, requiring reviewing fewer irrelevant
   documents to find the last relevant ones compared to state-of-the-art
   methods, even in the case of noisy answers. Further, they show that our
   algorithm learns to stop asking questions at the right time. Last, we
   conduct a small user study involving an expert reviewer. The user study
   validates some of the assumptions made in this work regarding the user's
   willingness to answer the system questions and the extent of it, as well
   as the ability of the user to answer these questions.}},

Abstract = {{Information institutions use text-based information retrieval systems to
   store, index and retrieve metadata, full-text, or both metadata and
   full-text (hybrid) contents. The aim of this research was to evaluate
   impact of these contents on information retrieval performance. For this
   purpose, metadata (MIR), full-text (FIR) and hybrid (HIR) content
   information retrieval systems were developed with default Lucene
   information retrieval model for a small scale Turkish corpus. In order
   to evaluate performance of this three systems, ``precision - recall{''}
   and ``normalized recall{''} tests were conducted. Experimental findings
   showed that there were no significant differences between MIR and FIR in
   mean average precision (MAP) performance. On the other hand, MAP
   performance of HIR was significantly higher in comparison to MIR and
   FIR. When information retrieval performance was evaluated as
   user-centered, the ``normalized recall{''} performances of MIR and HIR
   were significantly higher than FIR. Additionally, there were no
   significant differences between the systems in retrieved relevant
   document means. Processing different types of contents such as metadata
   and full-text had some advantages and disadvantages for information
   retrieval systems in terms of term management. The advantages brought
   together in hybrid content processing (HIR) and information retrieval
   performance improved.}},

   more relevant content. This article addresses the question of searching

Abstract = {{Information Retrieval (IR) plays a key role in diverse Software
   Engineering (SE) tasks. Similarity metric is the core component of any
   IR techniques whose performance differs for various document types.
   Different SE tasks operate on different types of documents like bug
   reports, software descriptions, source code, etc., that often contain
   non-standard domain-specific vocabulary. Thus, it is important to
   understand which similarity metrics are suitable for different SE
   documents.
   We analyze the performance of different similarity metrics on various SE
   documents including a diverse combination of textual (e.g., description,
   readme), code (e.g., source code, API, import package), and a mixture of
   text and code (e.g., bug reports) artifacts. We observe that, in
   general, the context-aware IR models achieve better performance on
   textual artifacts. In contrast, simple keyword-based bag-of-words models
   perform better in code artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of unstructured data grows with the popularization of the
   Internet. Texts in natural language represent a relevant and significant
   set for the analysis and production of knowledge. This work proposes a
   quantitative analysis of the preprocessing and training stages of a text
   classifier, which uses as an attribute the feelings expressed by the
   users. Artificial Neural Network, as a classifier algorithm, and texts
   from Amazon, IMDB and Yelp sites were used for the experiments. The
   database allows the analysis of the expression of positive and negative
   feelings of the users in evaluations of products and services in
   unstructured texts. Two distinct processes of preprocessing and
   different training of the Artificial Neural Networks were carried out to
   classify the textual set. The results quantitatively confirm the
   importance of the preprocessing and training stages of the classifier,
   highlighting the importance of the vocabulary selected for the text
   representation and classification. The available classification
   techniques achieve satisfactory results. However, even by using two
   distinct processes of preprocessing and identifying the best training
   process, it was not possible to totally eliminate the learning
   difficulties and understanding of the model for the classifications of
   feelings that involved subjective characteristics of the expression of
   human feeling.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, tremendous advances have been observed in information
   retrieval systems designed to search for relevant knowledge in
   scientific publications. Although these techniques are quite powerful,
   there is still room for improvement in the area of searching for
   metadata relating to algorithms in full-text publication datasetsfor
   instance, efficiency-related metrics such as precision, recall,
   f-measure and accuracy, and other useful metadata such as the datasets
   deployed and the algorithmic run-time complexity. In this study, we
   proposed a novel deep learning-based feature engineering approach that
   improves search capabilities by mining algorithmic-specific metadata
   from full-text scientific publications. Typically, traditional term
   frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)-based approaches function
   like a bag of words' model and thus fail to capture either the text's
   semantics or the word sequence. In this work, we designed a semantically
   enriched synopsis of each full-text document by adding
   algorithmic-specific deep metadata text lines to enhance the search
   mechanism of algorithm search systems. These text lines are classified
   by our deployed deep learning-based bi-directional long short term
   memory (LSTM) model. The designed bi-directional LSTM model outperformed
   the support vector machine by 9.46\%, with a 0.81f1-score on a dataset
   of 37,000 algorithm-specific deep metadata text lines that had been
   tagged by four human experts. Lastly, we present a case study on 21,940
   full-text publications downloaded from ACL (https://aclweb.org/) to show
   the effectiveness of deep learning-based advanced feature engineering
   search compared to the conventional TF-IDF-based (Lucene) search.}},

Abstract = {{The work presented in this paper aims at developing a Personalized
   Information Retrieval system in Arabic Texts ({''}PIRAT{''}) based on
   the user's preferences/interests. For this reason, we proposed a user's
   modeling and a personalized matching method document-query. The proposed
   user's modeling is based on a hybrid representation of the user profile.
   In this approach, we introduce an algorithm which automatically builds a
   hierarchical user profile that represents his implicit personal
   interests and domain. It is to represent the interests and the domain
   with a conceptual network of nodes linked together through relationships
   respecting the linking topology defined in the domain of hierarchies and
   ontologies (hyperonymy, hyponymy, and synonymy). Then, we address the
   problem of unavailable language resources by building (i) a large Arabic
   text corpus entitled ``WCAT{''} and (ii) Building our own Arabic queries
   corpus entitled ``AQC2{''} in order to evaluate the suggested PIRAT
   system and AXON system. The results of this evaluation are promising.}},

Abstract = {{Local searching systems development is not a trivial task. The amount of
   data is too large for an exhaustive search, but not enough for the

   Therefore, we need to integrate special algorithms for increasing the
   quality of searching. In this paper, we consider the ways of applying
   the machine-learning methods such as topic modeling and neural networks
   and demonstrate how we can increase search quality, based on the actual

Abstract = {{Document relational network has been effective in retrieving and
   evaluating papers. Despite their effectiveness, relational measures,
   including co-citation, are far from ideal and need improvements. The
   assumption underlying the co-citation relation is the content relevance
   and opinion relatedness of cited and citing papers. This may imply
   existence of some kind of co-opinionatedness between co-cited papers
   which may be effective in improving the measure. Therefore, the present
   study tries to test the existence of this phenomenon and its role in
   improving information retrieval. To do so, based on CITREC, a medical
   test collection was developed consisting of 30 queries (seed documents)
   and 4823 of their co-cited papers. Using NLP techniques, the co-citances
   of the queries and their co-cited papers were analyzed and their
   similarities were computed by 4g similarity measure. Opinion scores were
   extracted from co-citances using SentiWordnet. Also, nDCG values were
   calculated and then compared in terms of the citation proximity index
   (CPI) and co-citedness measures before and after being normalized by the
   co-opinionatedness measure. The reliability of the test collection was
   measured by generalizability theory. The findings suggested that a
   majority of the co-citations exhibited a high level of
   co-opinionatedness in that they were mostly similar either in their
   opinion strengths or in their polarities. Although anti-polar
   co-citations were not trivial in their number, a significantly higher
   number of the co-citations were co-polar, with a majority being
   positive. The evaluation of the normalization of the CPI and
   co-citedness by the co-opinionatedness indicated a generally significant
   improvement in retrieval effectiveness. While anti-polar similarity
   reduced the effectiveness of the measure, the co-polar similarity proved
   to be effective in improving the co-citedness. Consequently, the
   co-opinionatedness can be presented as a new document relation and used
   as a normalization factor to improve retrieval performance and research
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a great deal of work on collection selection.
   Most collection selection methods use central sample index (CSI) that
   consists of some documents sampled from each collection as collection
   description. The limitations of these methods are the usage of `flat'
   meaning representations that ignore structure and relationships among
   words in CSI, and the calculation of query-collection similarity metric
   that ignore semantic distance between query words and indexed words. In
   this paper, we propose a knowledge based collection selection method
   (KBCS) to improve collection representation and query-collection
   similarity metric. KBCS models a collection as a weighted entity set and
   applies a novel query-collection similarity metric to select highly
   scored collections. Specifically, in the part of collection
   representation, context and structure-based measures are employed to
   weight the semantic distance between two entities extracted from the
   sampled documents of a collection. In addition, the novel
   query-collection similarity metric takes the entity weight, collection
   size, and other factors into account. To enrich concepts contained in a
   query, DBpedia based query expansion is integrated. Finally, extensive
   experiments were conducted on a large webpage dataset, and DBpedia was
   chosen as the graph knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of KBCS.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing amount of electronic information, a majority of
   laypeople (ordinary people with no professional medical knowledge) now
   rely on the Web to seek for health information for self-diagnosis.
   However, research has shown that current search engines are failing to
   deliver effective search results due to the inability of laypeople to
   formulate good queries because of lack of domain knowledge and
   unfamiliarity with the medical vocabulary and concepts. This article
   attempts to address this by proposing a Selective Collection Enrichment
   approach that uses three different external resources to enrich a user
   query, thus generating three different expanded queries. In addition, we
   deploy pre-retrieval query performance predictors to select an expanded
   query that is most likely to perform better when retrieving on a local
   collection being searched. Furthermore, we evaluate the effects of
   combining several pre-retrieval query performance predictors' scores
   using data fusion techniques for Selective Collection Enrichment. Our
   empirical evaluation shows marked improvement in the retrieval
   performance in terms of nDCG@10 when the Selective Collection Enrichment
   approach is deployed.}},

   definition of metadata needs to contemplate, besides the description of
   the contents, associative relationships that take into account the
   changes in spelling implemented during the period in which the contents
   of the newspapers were developed, due to the historical context of the
   documents. Interoperability standards, preservation and open access

Abstract = {{Objectives: To create test collections for evaluating clinical
   information retrieval (IR) systems and advancing clinical IR research.
   Materials and Methods: Electronic health record (EHR) data, including
   structured and free-text data, from 45 000 patients who are a part of
   the Mayo Clinic Biobank cohort was retrieved from the clinical data
   warehouse. The clinical IR system indexed a total of 42 million
   free-text EHR documents. The search queries consisted of 56 topics
   developed through a collaboration between Mayo Clinic and Oregon Health
   \& Science University. We described the creation of test collections,
   including a to-be-evaluated document pool using five retrieval models,
   and human assessment guidelines. We analyzed the relevance judgment
   results in terms of human agreement and time spent, and results of three
   levels of relevance, and reported performance of five retrieval models.
   Results: The two judges had a moderate overall agreement with a Kappa
   value of 0.49, spent a consistent amount of time judging the relevance,
   and were able to identify easy and difficult topics. The conventional
   retrieval model performed best on most topics while a concept-based
   retrieval model had better performance on the topics requiring
   conceptual level retrieval.
   Discussion: IR can provide an alternate approach to leveraging clinical
   narratives for patient information discovery as it is less dependent on
   semantics. Our study showed the feasibility of test collections along
   with a few challenges.
   Conclusion: The conventional test collections for evaluating the IR
   system show potential for successfully evaluating clinical IR systems
   with a few challenges to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is the
   adoption of translation knowledge in retrieval models, as it affects
   term weighting which is known to highly impact the retrieval
   performance. Despite its importance, how different approaches for
   integration of translation knowledge into retrieval models relatively
   perform has not been analytically examined. In this paper, we present an
   analytical investigation of using translation knowledge in CLIR. In
   particular, by adopting the axiomatic analysis framework, we formulate
   impacts of using translation knowledge on document ranking as
   constraints that any cross-language retrieval model should satisfy. We
   then consider state-of-the-art CLIR methods and check whether they
   satisfy these constraints. Our study shows that none of the existing
   methods satisfies all constraints. Based on the defined constraints, we
   propose the hierarchical query modeling method for CLIR which satisfies
   more constraints and achieves a higher CLIR performance, compared to the
   existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Users seeking information may not find relevant information pertaining
   to their information need in a specific language. But information may be
   available in a language different from their own, but users may not know
   that language. Thus users may experience difficulty in accessing the
   information present in different languages. Since the retrieval process
   depends on the translation of the user query, there are many issues in
   getting the right translation of the user query. For a pair of languages
   chosen by a user, resources, like incomplete dictionary, inaccurate
   machine translation system may exist. These resources may be
   insufficient to map the query terms in one language to its equivalent
   terms in another language. Also for a given query, there might exist
   multiple correct translations. The underlying corpus evidence may
   suggest a clue to select a probable set of translations that could
   eventually perform a better information retrieval. In this paper, we
   present a cross language information retrieval approach to effectively
   retrieve information present in a language other than the language of
   the user query using the corpus driven query suggestion approach. The
   idea is to utilize the corpus based evidence of one language to improve
   the retrieval and re-ranking of news documents in the another language.
   We use FIRE corpora - Tamil and English news collections - in our
   experiments and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed cross
   language information retrieval approach.}},

Abstract = {{Information Retrieval (IR) is a common technique used to manage a
   growing technical document collection. Owing to the complexity of
   technical documents, the direct application of IR often leads to
   unsatisfactory results. Therefore, many semantic approaches, such as
   ontology, are applied to enhance IR performance. However, ontology
   development is often a labor-intensive process and the availability of
   ontologies significantly influences the applicability of IR.
   Consequently, many efforts are dedicated to the automation of the
   ontology development process for reducing the human labors. In addition,
   reference collections, which are developed as the golden standards to
   evaluate IR performance in many IR research, can be regarded as an
   available resource for ontology development. To ease domain ontology
   development for supporting IR, this research proposes a semi-automated
   approach to develop a base domain ontology from a reference collection.
   This research also validates the base ontology on an Earthquake
   Engineering reference collection, called the NCREE (National Center for
   Research on Earthquake Engineering) collection. The results reveal that
   the human workload of the proposed approach is affordable. Furthermore,
   the base domain ontology can help achieve a satisfactory IR performance.}},

Abstract = {{Social media has become almost ubiquitous in present times. Such
   proliferation leads to automatic information processing need and has
   various challenges. The nature of social media content is mostly
   informal. Additionally while talking about Indian social media, users
   often prefer to use Roman transliterations of their native languages and
   English embedding. Therefore Information retrieval (IR) on such Indian
   social media data is a challenging and difficult task when the documents
   and the queries are a mixture of two or more languages written in either
   the native scripts and/or in the Roman transliterated form. Here in this
   paper we have emphasized issues related with Information Retrieval (IR)
   for Code-Mixed Indian social media texts, particularly texts from
   twitter. We describe a corpus collection process, reported limitations
   of available state-of-the-art IR systems on such data and formalize the

Abstract = {{The conversion of unstructured big data into knowledgeable information
   has been the hotspot of search applications today. Nearly 75\% of
   queries issued to Web search engines aim at finding information about
   entities. In an ideal case, the user wants to know the relations
   existing between the data objects. Conceptual knowledge graph provides
   an efficient way for exploring such relations. Past researches relied on
   knowledge bases like DBpedia to build such graphs. In this paper, we
   introduce a method that automatically extracts the key aspects of search
   query from the Wikipedia corpus. The extracted relations are dynamically
   expressed as a knowledge graph. Additionally, the system returns the
   list of results i.e., Wikipedia documents ranked in the order of their
   relevance in response to the search query. Thus, the proposed system can
   be viewed as an information retrieval system that leverages knowledge
   graph to provide more promising information to the user.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to test whether query expansion by approximate
   string matching methods is beneficial in retrieval from historical
   newspaper collections in a language rich with compounds and inflectional
   forms (Finnish). First, approximate string matching methods were used to
   generate lists of index words most similar to contemporary query terms
   in a digitized newspaper collection from the 1800s. Top index word
   variants were categorized to estimate the appropriate query expansion
   ranges in the retrieval test. Second, the effectiveness of approximate
   string matching methods, automatically generated inflectional forms, and
   their combinations were measured in a Cranfield-style test. Finally, a
   detailed topic-level analysis of test results was conducted. In the
   index of historical newspaper collection the occurrences of a word
   typically spread to many linguistic and historical variants along with
   optical character recognition (OCR) errors. All query expansion methods
   improved the baseline results. Extensive expansion of around 30 variants
   for each query word was required to achieve the highest performance
   improvement. Query expansion based on approximate string matching was
   superior to using the inflectional forms of the query words, showing
   that coverage of the different types of variation is more important than
   precision in handling one type of variation.}},

Abstract = {{Neural word embedding approaches, due to their ability to capture
   semantic meanings of vocabulary terms, have recently gained attention of
   the information retrieval (IR) community and have shown promising
   results in improving ad hoc retrieval performance. It has been observed
   that these approaches are sensitive to various choices made during the
   learning of word embeddings and their usage, often leading to poor
   reproducibility. We study the effect of varying following two
   parameters, viz., i) the term normalization and ii) the choice of
   training collection, on ad hoc retrieval performance with word2vec and
   fastText embeddings. We present quantitative estimates of similarity of
   word vectors obtained under different settings, and use embeddings based
   query expansion task to understand the effects of these parameters on IR
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Personalization of information retrieval tailors search towards
   individual users to meet their particular information needs by taking
   into account information about users and their contexts, often through
   implicit sources of evidence such as user behaviors. This study looks at
   users' dwelling behavior on documents and several contextual factors:
   the stage of users' work tasks, task type, and users' knowledge of task
   topics, to explore whether or not taking account contextual factors
   could help infer document usefulness from dwell time. A controlled
   laboratory experiment was conducted with 24 participants, each coming 3
   times to work on 3 subtasks in a general work task. The results show
   that task stage could help interpret certain types of dwell time as
   reliable indicators of document usefulness in certain task types, as was
   topic knowledge, and the latter played a more significant role when both
   were available. This study contributes to a better understanding of how
   dwell time can be used as implicit evidence of document usefulness, as
   well as how contextual factors can help interpret dwell time as an
   indicator of usefulness. These findings have both theoretical and
   practical implications for using behaviors and contextual factors in the
   development of personalization systems.}},

Title = {{Extracting translations from comparable corpora for Cross-Language
   Information Retrieval using the language modeling framework}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A main challenge in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is to
   estimate a proper translation model from available translation
   resources, since translation quality directly affects the retrieval
   performance. Among different translation resources, we focus on
   obtaining translation models from comparable corpora, because they
   provide appropriate translations for both languages and domains with
   limited linguistic resources. In this paper, we employ a two-step
   approach to build an effective translation model from comparable
   corpora, without requiring any additional linguistic resources, for the
   CLIR task. In the first step, translations are extracted by deriving
   correlations between source-target word pairs. These correlations are
   used to estimate word translation probabilities in the second step. We
   propose a language modeling approach for the first step, where modeling
   based on probability distribution provides two key advantages. First,
   our approach can be tuned easier in comparison with heuristically
   adjusted previous work. Second, it provides a principled basis for
   integrating additional lexical and translational relations to improve
   the accuracy of translations from comparable corpora. As an indication,
   we integrate monolingual relations of word co-occurrences into the
   process of translation extraction, which helps to extract more reliable
   translations for low-frequency words in a comparable corpus.
   Experimental results on an English-Persian comparable corpus show that
   our method outperforms the previous approaches in terms of both
   translation quality and the performance of CUR. Indeed, the proposed
   method is naturally applicable to any comparable corpus, regardless of
   its languages. In addition, we demonstrate the significant impact of
   word translation probabilities, estimated in the second step of our
   approach, on the performance of CLIR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ZIN)-is one of
   the oldest scientific institutions in Russia with unique scientific
   collections. In 2017, the Museum and the Institute celebrated their
   185th anniversary. The unique collection of the ZIN were collected by
   many generations of Russian and foreign zoologists throughout the
   territories and waters of our planet. Collected during these expeditions
   materials are stored in the Institute, they remain imperishable source
   of information on the structure and distribution of faunal diversity in
   space and time. The collections continue to rise. ZIN has one of the
   largest zoological collections in the world, with more than 60 million
   of storage units. In general, in the collections of the ZIN about 260
   thousand species of animals, which is about a quarter of the known world
   fauna, are presented. There is almost all the animal species inhabiting
   territory and waters of Russia, for many of them large series are
   stored. Several tens of thousands of type specimens of animal species
   stored in the collection are of exceptional value. The content of the
   concept of ``zoological collection{''} in our days of rapid progress of
   information technologies and advances in molecular genetic studies
   quickly filled with new meanings. Currently, the collection is
   rightfully regarded as a bank of scientific information and the primary
   tool for basic and applied biological research. The information system
   should include taxonomical, type, collection, zoogeographical and
   bibliographic data. By using of available server infrastructure of ZIN
   and information system of collection specimens created (ZIN Research
   Collections portal, https://www.zin.ru/collections/), there was a
   possibility of selective publication of ZIN research collection data via
   GBIF portal (http://ipt.zin.ru). The scientific use of the collections
   and depositories of integrated information systems for faunistic
   biodiversity in the present context includes, as the most important
   modern goals, digitization of collections and publication of information
   in the public domain on the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{In information retrieval evaluation, pooling is a well-known technique
   to extract a sample of documents to be assessed for relevance. Given the
   pooled documents, a number of studies have proposed different
   prioritization methods to adjudicate documents for judgment. These
   methods follow different strategies to reduce the assessment effort.
   However, there is no clear guidance on how many relevance judgments are
   required for creating a reliable test collection. In this article we
   investigate and further develop methods to determine when to stop making
   relevance judgments. We propose a highly diversified set of stopping
   methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of the
   resulting test collections. Some of the stopping methods introduced here
   combine innovative estimates of recall with time series models used in
   Financial Trading. Experimental results on several representative
   collections show that some stopping methods can reduce up to 95\% of the
   assessment effort and still produce a robust test collection. We
   demonstrate that the reduced set of judgments can be reliably employed
   to compare search systems using disparate effectiveness metrics such as
   Average Precision, NDCG, P@100, and Rank Biased Precision. With all
   these measures, the correlations found between full pool rankings and
   reduced pool rankings is very high.}},
