Agent behavior is arguably the greatest source of uncertainty in trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles. This problem has motivated significant amounts of work in the behavior prediction community on learning rich distributions of the future states and actions of agents. However, most current works on chance-constrained trajectory planning under agent or obstacle uncertainty either assume Gaussian uncertainty or linear constraints, which is limiting, or requires sampling, which can be computationally intractable to encode in an optimization problem. In this letter, we extend the state-of-the-art by presenting a methodology to upper-bound chance-constraints defined by polynomials and mixture models with potentially non-Gaussian components. Our method achieves its generality by using statistical moments of the distributions in concentration inequalities to upper-bound the probability of constraint violation. With this method, optimization-based trajectory planners can plan trajectories that are chance-constrained with respect to a wide range of distributions representing predictions of agent future positions. In experiments, we show that the resulting optimization problem can be solved with state-of-the-art nonlinear program solvers to plan trajectories fast enough for use online. A,A(C) 2016 IEEE.
