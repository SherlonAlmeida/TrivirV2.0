This article describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an active lane change control algorithm for autonomous vehicles with human factor considerations. Lane changes need to be performed considering both driver acceptance and safety with surrounding vehicles. Therefore, autonomous driving systems need to be designed based on an analysis of human driving behavior. In this article, manual driving characteristics are investigated using real-world driving test data. In lane change situations, interactions with surrounding vehicles were mainly investigated. And safety indices were developed with kinematic analysis. A safety indicesA cent a,aoebased lane change decision and control algorithm has been developed. In order to improve safety, stochastic predictions of both the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles have been conducted with consideration of sensor noise and model uncertainties. The desired driving mode is decided to cope with all lane changes on highway. To obtain desired reference and constraints, motion planning for lane changes has been designed taking stochastic prediction-based safety indices into account. A stochastic model predictive control with constraints has been adopted to determine vehicle control inputs: the steering angle and the longitudinal acceleration. The proposed active lane change algorithm has been successfully implemented on an autonomous vehicle and evaluated via real-world driving tests. Safe and comfortable lane changes in high-speed driving on highways have been demonstrated using our autonomous test vehicle. A,A(C) IMechE 2020.
