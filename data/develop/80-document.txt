Intelligent vehicle includes perception, planning, control, decision making and interaction. Path planning and vehicle control act the vehicle directly, and its stability, safety and efficiency play an important role in intelligent driving systems. This article researches optimal path planning and vehicle tracking control capabilities in specific scenario, by the motion description of the vehicle kinematics model, establishing the out-parking map and creating reference path, combining with the model predictive control optimization algorithm and collaborating with sensors and devices which supported by a development project. By analyzing test data, all parts of designed can achieve the expected function, and the overall performance is good. A,A(C) 2019 IEEE.
