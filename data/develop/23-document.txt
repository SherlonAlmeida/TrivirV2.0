Purpose of this research was to develop a searching technology application based on the Android operating system and the utilization of Quick Response Code (QR code) technology as main data storage. The scope of the information searching was limited to locating temples within the districts of Dusit and PhraNakorn of the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. The developer considered the importance of communication through detailed data collection and gathering so that the users of this application could obtain concise and complete information. The result of this research project was that tourists could use the ability of smart devices to scan the QR code via the developed application that subsequently processed and rendered various information, including pictures, history and details of the requested temple inquiries on the displays. The assessment results on the viewpoints of two hundred tourist users in the average of the overall picture was at 4.20, which should be considered to be a good level. The researcher's suggestion was to extend methods of information searching to increase speed, accuracy and correct information to produce maximum benefits and effectiveness that users of this application could expect to receive.
