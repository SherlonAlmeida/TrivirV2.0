Lane changes are complex safety-and throughput-critical driver actions. Most lane-changing models deal with lane-changing maneuvers solely from the merging driverA cent a,a,, cent s standpoint and thus ignore driver interaction. To overcome this shortcoming, we develop a game-theoretical decision-making model and validate the model using empirical merging maneuver data at a freeway on-ramp. Specifically, this paper advances our repeated game model by using updated payoff functions. Validation results using the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) empirical data show that the developed game-theoretical model provides better prediction accuracy compared to previous work, giving correct predictions approximately 86% of the time. In addition, a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the rationality of the model and its sensitivity to variations in various factors. To provide evidence of the benefits of the repeated game approach, which takes into account previous decision-making results, a case study is conducted using an agent-based simulation model. The proposed repeated game model produces superior performance to a one-shot game model when simulating actual freeway merging behaviors. Finally, this lane change model, which captures the collective decision-making between human drivers, can be used to develop automated vehicle driving strategies. A,A(C) 2020 by the authors.
