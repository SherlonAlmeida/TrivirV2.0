Shared control schemes allow a human driver to work with an automated driving agent in driver-vehicle systems while retaining the driver&#x02BC s abilities to control. The human driver, as an essential agent in the driver-vehicle shared control systems, should be precisely modeled regarding their cognitive processes, control strategies, and decision-making processes. The interactive strategy design between drivers and automated driving agents brings an excellent challenge for human-centric driver assistance systems due to the inherent characteristics of humans. Many open-ended questions arise, such as what proper role of human drivers should act in a shared control scheme &#x003F How to make an intelligent decision capable of balancing the benefits of agents in shared control systems &#x003F Due to the advent of these attentions and questions, it is desirable to present a survey on the decisionA,A making between human drivers and highly automated vehicles, to understand their architectures, human driver modeling, and interaction strategies under the driver-vehicle shared schemes. Finally, we give a further discussion on the key future challenges and opportunities. They are likely to shape new potential research directions. IEEE
