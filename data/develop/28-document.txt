A factographic information retrieval with human involvement which consists of two stages is given detailed consideration in this paper. In the first stage, the retrieval without direct human involvement is implemented. In the second stage, the retrieval assumes the human involvement. This retrieval includes a pattern recognition algorithm, and they are implemented for retrieval only one document among the variety of similar documents. An analytical model of the retrieval block is developed. This model is presented by effectiveness indicator: average length of the recommendatory list provided by the retrieval block enabling the human operator to take the final decision.
