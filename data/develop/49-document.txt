Autonomous driving system (ADS) is a combination of different components those can be composed as operations of the automobile and decision making mechanisms both in regular time and unexpected situations. These operations are performed by a virtual driver to carry out the objectives that are determined by the users. The main advantages of ADS are to free the drivers from attention states which are presented by American Automobile Association Foundation (AAAF). At the same time, there are some safety risks for these systems those need to be tested and solved. In this paper, we analyzed ADS to prioritize risks by using Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) that can be used to represent uncertainty in decision process. For this aim, a methodology based on Pythagorean analytic hierarchy process (PAHP) has been suggested. By the way, the Hazard Analysis and Risks Assessment introduced in the ISO 26262 standards are taken as a basis for risk evaluation. A,A(C) 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
