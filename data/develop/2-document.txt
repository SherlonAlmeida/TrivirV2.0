A smart city is an urban area that uses data collected from citizens, devices, and assets to manage resources efficiently. It can be argued that autonomous cars will spread related to this concept. However, the implementation and adaptation of the autonomous cars is a complex process due to human factors and traffic. Therefore, it is expected that autonomous vehicle (AV) will find its place first in the heavy transportation as it is more cost efficient and easier to adapt. In order to adapt intercity transportation routes to autonomous trucks, an investment should be made on Information and Communications Technology such as sensors and cameras connected to the network with Internet of Things. In this study, the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem for road selection for autonomous trucks in Turkey is examined. Although self-driving trucks are not yet introduced, this study aims to pioneer by examining truck roads in between industrial areas and decide which road would be better fit to start an autonomous truck investment. As there are many uncertainties in the nature of this decision, the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method will be used for decision-making.
