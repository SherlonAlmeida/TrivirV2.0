In this paper, fuzzy finite transition systems and fuzzy transformation semigroups are analyzed when the truth structure is the set of all the closed real subintervals contained in . Our approach involves the application of interval-valued fuzzy sets techniques in order to retrieve the information given by the transition functions of the considered automata. In particular, a characterization of those Atanassov's  operators which provide a fuzzy transformation semigroup starting from an interval-valued fuzzy automaton is achieved. Conversely, different ways of getting an interval-valued fuzzy transformation semigroup starting from two real fuzzy automata are compared.
