To promote the development of unmanned ground vehicles, it is very necessary to establish a scientific and reasonable evaluation system for unmanned ground vehicles. This paper analyses the structure and operation of unmanned ground vehicles, and also proposes a multi-attribute comprehensive evaluation system for unmanned ground vehicles. Based on six aspects including environment perception, communication command, behavioural decision-making, human-computer interaction, weapon system and mobile platform, a new evaluation indicator system is established. In the quantitative process of qualitative indicators, Z-number theory is introduced to better describe the uncertainty degree of judgment and reasoning in human's understanding of complex things. In order to make the indicator weights more scientific, the combined weighting model with analytic hierarchy process and information entropy is adopted for weight analysis, which not only takes into account the influence of evaluation experts on weights, but also reduces the subjective arbitrariness of weights. The least-squares grey relational analysis method is used to analyse the correlation between the comparison series and the reference series, and a comprehensive quantitative evaluation result of the unmanned ground vehicles is obtained. The evaluation examples of unmanned ground vehicles show that the proposed evaluation system can quantitatively evaluate the overall technical performance of unmanned ground vehicles. This evaluation system has high reference value for the evaluation of other complex weapons. A,A(C) Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
