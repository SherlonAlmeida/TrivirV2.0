We have described our work in planning for influencing interactions in autonomous driving at two levels: (i) vehicle-to-vehicle interaction, in which an autonomous car influences human-driven cars for safer and more efficient driving behavior; and (ii) global-level interaction, in which a large number of autonomous and human-driven vehicles interact in the same traffic network. We design routing decisions for autonomous vehicles that influence humansA cent a,a,, cent routing choices in order to decrease the total delay of the traffic network for a more desirable societal objective. Autonomous systems are weaving their way into daily life as robots and the Internet of Things move into homes and smart cities become a reality. Our long-term goal is to develop a theory for modeling and designing the effects of automation and robotics on human decision making, and this work is a first step toward developing efficient robotics algorithms that lead to safe and transparent autonomous systems as they interact with and influence humans and society.
