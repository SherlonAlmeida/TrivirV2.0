Path planning for a ground vehicle in an urban environment is considered. The vehicle is equipped with a GPS receiver and a road map. The vehicle desires to take the shortest path to reach a target destination, while guaranteeing that integrity monitoring-based measures are satisfied along its traversed path. A path planning algorithm is proposed that yields the optimal path to follow as well as suboptimal feasible paths. The integrity monitoring-based measure considered in this paper is the horizontal protection level (HPL), which refers to the statistical bound around the vehicle that guarantees the probability of the absolute position error exceeding a desired threshold is not larger than the integrity risk. Experimental results are presented showing that choosing the optimal path from the proposed algorithm reduces the average and maximum HPL by 2 m and 20.2 m, respectively, compared to choosing the shortest-time path, while introducing a negligible additional path length.
