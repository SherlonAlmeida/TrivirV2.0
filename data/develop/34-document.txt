The paper introduces PolaritySim â€“ a novel approach to disambiguating context-dependent sentiment polarity of words. The task of resolving the polarity of a given word instance as positive or negative is addressed as an information retrieval problem. At the pre-processing stage, a vector of context features is built for each word w based on all its occurrences in the positive polarity corpus (consumer reviews with high ratings) and another vector â€“ on its contexts in the negative polarity corpus (reviews with low ratings). Lexico-syntactic context features are automatically generated from dependency parse graphs of the sentences containing the word. These two vectors are treated as â€œdocumentsâ€, one with positive and one with negative polarity. To resolve the contextual polarity of a specific instance of the word w in a given sentence, its context feature vector is built in the same way, and is treated as the â€œqueryâ€. An information retrieval (IR) model is then applied to calculate the similarity of the â€œqueryâ€ to each of the two â€œdocumentsâ€, with the polarity of the best matching â€œdocumentâ€ attributed to the â€œqueryâ€. The method uses no prior polarity sentiment lexicons or purposefully annotated training datasets. The only external resource used is a readily available corpus of user-rated reviews. Evaluation on different domains shows more effective performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifiers, on three out of four datasets. PolaritySim, SVM and MNB were also evaluated with an out-of-domain training corpus. The results indicate that PolaritySim is more effective and robust when used with an out-of-domain corpus compared to SVM and MNB. We conclude that an IR based approach can be an effective and robust alternative to machine learning approaches for disambiguating word-level polarity using either within-domain, or out-of-domain training corpora.
