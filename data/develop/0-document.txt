In this paper, we propose TRIVIR, a novel interactive visualization tool powered by an Information Retrieval (IR) engine that implements an active learning protocol to support IR with high recall. The system integrates multiple graphical views in order to assist the user identifying the relevant documents in a collection, including a content-based similarity map obtained with multidimensional projection techniques. Given representative documents as queries, users can interact with the views to label documents as relevant/not relevant, and this information is used to train a machine learning (ML) algorithm which suggests other potentially relevant documents on demand. TRIVIR offers two major advantages over existing visualization systems for IR. First, it merges the ML algorithm output into the visualization, while supporting several user interactions in order to enhance and speed up its convergence. Second, it tackles the problem of vocabulary mismatch, by providing termâ€™s synonyms and a view that conveys how the terms are used within the collection. Besides, TRIVIR has been developed as a flexible front-end interface that can be associated with distinct text representations and multidimensional projection techniques. We describe two use cases conducted with collaborators who are potential users of TRIVIR. Results show that the system simplified the search for relevant documents in large collections, based on the context in which the terms occur.
