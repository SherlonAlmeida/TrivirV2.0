Semantic relation based personalized ranking approach for engineering document retrieval

Since engineering design is heavily informational, engineers want to retrieve existing engineering documents accurately during the product development process. However, engineers have difficulties searching for documents because of low retrieval accuracy. One of the reasons for this is the limitation of existing document ranking approaches, in which relationships between terms in documents are not considered to assess the relevance of the retrieved documents. Therefore, we propose a new ranking approach that provides more correct evaluation of document relevance to a given query. Our approach exploits domain ontology to consider relationships among terms in the relevance scoring process. Based on domain ontology, the semantics of a document are represented by a graph (called Document Semantic Network) and, then, proposed relation-based weighting schemes are used to evaluate the graph to calculate the document relevance score. In our ranking approach, user interests and searching intent are also considered in order to provide personalized services. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing ranking approaches. A precisely represented semantics of a document as a graph and multiple relation-based weighting schemes are important factors underlying the notable improvement.
