With a model predictive control approach including boundary analysis and uncertain prediction of activities of different road participants, this paper proposes solutions that support motion control by steering control and appropriate acceleration to create safe motion trajectories for an autonomous vehicle. The motion control support element is determined by the principle of minimal intervention and can handle complex situations, while building control model to predict real-time operation with speed factors, ability to control driving and limit the long period. The performance of this solution is assessed through simulation, then there are applied research orientations on practical autonomous vehicle accounting. A,A(C) 2020 ASTES Publishers.
