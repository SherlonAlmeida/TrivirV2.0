With the exponential growth in web content, the answers provided by traditional search engines by query specific keywords to content has resulted in markedly high recall and low precision. Semantic information retrieval can enhance the relevancy of search results by understanding search intention and the contextual meaning of terms as they are entered by the user. In this paper, a novel method for supporting semantic information retrieval is proposed by building a domain specific ontology. A prototype of a fuzzy semantic search engine is developed and the results are compared with that of a traditional search engine.
