Decision Making Using Automated Estimates in the Classification of Novel Stimuli

In large-scale, remotely operated systems of autonomous vehicles, human operators&#x2019; situation awareness will depend on their use of multiple information sources which may include target classification estimates provided by the system. This experiment assessed to what degree participants relied on a likelihood estimate to assist in the classification of novel stimuli in varying levels of uncertainty. Participants were trained to classify two sets of novel visual stimuli, then classified variations of the stimuli with the aid of an estimate displaying the likelihood of belonging to either group. The results showed that participants were able to integrate the automated estimate into their classification responses, and as the level of uncertainty increased, the average reliance on the automated estimate also increased. The findings show that training participants to identify new stimuli, then presenting participants with a likelihood estimate in conjunction with the visual stimuli may facilitate situation awareness in conditions of uncertainty. &#x00A9; 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
