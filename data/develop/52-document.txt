Rapidly developing Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has potential to provide solutions to some of the aging population challenges, such as social isolation resulting from an inability to be independently mobile. However for AVs success, users&#x2019; acceptance is essential. Fifteen participants (M 70 years) participated in an autonomous driving simulator trial with voice-based CAV status feedback in a decision-making scenario &#x2013; whether to pick up a friend on the way. The within-subject conditions/journeys were: Audio feedback (Audio)/Pick-Up; Audio/No-Pick-Up; No-Audio/Pick-Up. Additionally, the effect of feedback during different external journey conditions was also considered, resulting in two between-subjects conditions &#x2013; day and night travel. Participants physiological, cognitive and affective measures show greater situational awareness and workload ratings in the No-Audio/Pick-Up condition with increased Post-trial trust rating and overall higher positive affect. These results indicate that the greatest concentration was required in the no-sound condition, suggesting that sound/multimodal feedback improved ease of operation and journey experience. &#x00A9; 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
