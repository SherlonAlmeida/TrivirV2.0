Methods and trends of biomedical and genomic information retrieval based on semantic relations of thesauri and MeSH

In the field of genomic science and medicine in general, there are two methods of retrieving information from documents, namely: 1) through the combined use of associations determined by the Medical Subject Headings, and 2) by employing specific terminologies, such as those in folksonomies, alternative medical-genomic terms in use in the general language, or acronyms or apocopes from the genomics field. To some extent, many thinkers in matters of indexing hold that the combination of two methods may be the best approach. While few authors advocate for keeping the structure of controlled vocabularies, built up over many years of content interpretation, unchanged, there are numerous proposals for expanding the search horizons of thesauri, whether through social cataloging, algorithmic domain analyses that contrast indicators or the semantic web, using markers of meaningful semantic lexicons contained in digitized text.
