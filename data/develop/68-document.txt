Efficient transportation is an important requirement in todayA cent a,a,, cent s world. As modern cities grow in size and complexity, the travel distances for people and goods increase while available time decreases. Routes must be computed dynamically and close to real-time, while taking into consideration various factors such as road congestion and maximum speed allowed. In this paper, we explore the use of evolutionary algorithms to solve this multiple criteria optimization problem. The performance analysis included in this study identifies the best configuration for the genetic routing algorithm which provides the best consistency of correct routes.
