RECENTLY, AUTOMATED DRIVING HAS MORE AND MORE BEEN TRANSFORMED FROM AN EXCITING VISION INTO HANDS ON REALITY BY PROTOTYPES. WHILE DRIVERS ARE USED TO ASSISTANCE AND MAYBE EVEN AUTOMATION FOR DRIVING WITHIN A LANE, IT IS EXCITING TO DARE A STEP AHEAD: DECIDING AND EXECUTING TACTICAL MANEUVERS LIKE LANE CHANGES IN AUTOMATED VEHICLES WITHOUT ANY HUMAN INTERACTION. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT OUR APPROACH FOR TACTICAL BEHAVIOR PLANNING FOR LANE CHANGES. WE PRESENT A WAY TO TACKLE PERCEPTION UNCERTAINTIES AND HOW TO ACHIEVE PROVIDENT, PREDICTION-BASED BEHAVIOR PLANNING. FOR THIS, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL FRAMEWORK TO PLAN IN HIGH-DIMENSIONAL, MIXED-INTEGER STATE SPACES IN REAL-TIME. OUR APPROACH IS EVALUATED NOT ONLY IN SIMULATION, BUT ALSO IN REAL TRAFFIC. THE IMPLEMENTATION HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO THE PUBLIC IN THE AUDI A7 PILOTED DRIVING CONCEPT VEHICLE, DRIVING FROM STANFORD TO THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW (CES) 2015 IN LAS VEGAS.
