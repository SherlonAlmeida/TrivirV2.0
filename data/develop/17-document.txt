Under the condition of inaccurate measurement or prediction of ocean currents, the existing path planning algorithms based on deterministic ocean currents have low robustness and the resultant paths may be infeasible. To solve these problems, this paper presents a time-optimal path planning algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on the interval optimization. The proposed scheme adopts a two-layer architecture. The outer layer uses ant colony system (ACS) algorithm to find candidate path from starting point to end point; In the inner layer, the upper and lower bounds of travelling time for candidate path are calculated under the environment model of interval ocean currents. Then, the travelling time interval is transformed into a deterministic value by interval order relation and reliability-based possibility degree of interval, and the value is returned to the outer layer as the fitness value of candidate path. The simulation results show that, comparing with the path planning scheme with deterministic ocean currents, the proposed scheme enhances the robustness of path planner and solves the problem that the resultant path may be infeasible.
