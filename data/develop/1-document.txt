As the use of self-driving vehicles become substantially possible, attention should be turned to focus on peopleA cent a,a,, cent s adoption of those vehicles. Factors affecting the opinions and perception towards the behavioral intention to use the self-driving vehicles have positive and negative impacts on individualA cent a,a,, cent s adaptation. One of the main characteristics of that of factors is its uncertainties and vagueness in many aspects. Evaluation of those factors requires a multi-criteria decision-making approach to better address the uncertainties associated with decision-makersA cent a,a,, cent judgments. The main purpose of this study is to assess the weight coefficients of factors affecting adoption of self-driving vehicles through using interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy AHP. The researchA cent a,a,, cent s contribution lies in identifying and weighting the sub-criteria of factors pertaining to acceptance of self-driving vehicle under Pythagorean fuzzy environment, in which the study takes into consideration psychological, safety, driving-related and external factors. The identification of criteria in accordance with their relative weight coefficients would help policy-makers and those who develop and manufacture self-driving vehicles.
