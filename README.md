# Description
TRIVIR is an interactive system that applies visual analytics and human-computer interaction concepts to help users perform queries in document collections based on relevant information. The system interface provides several functionalities that allow investigating relationships among documents. Once the user identifies a relevant document in the corpus, she can label it to represent its relevance to her needs. The system can be retrained and learn from users' feedbacks to provide more accurate recommendations.
